,,,,,,
"In this paper we show that the helium-like hydrogen spectra obtained by Randell L. Mills and ultra-dense hydrogen obtained by Holmlid can be interpreted as experimental evidence of Binuclear Atoms. The hydrogen Binuclear Atom, a model proposed 25 years ago, is a metastable configuration in which the two nuclei are held together at a very short distance in an atom-like configuration. This should be a distinctive configuration of the hydrogen molecule where nuclei are characterized by a high kinetic energy, and nuclear motion is coupled with electronic motion. This is a completely different model from the usual Born-Oppenheimer picture of atoms and molecules we are used to, where nuclei oscillate about their equilibrium positions and electronic motion is decoupled from the nuclear one. The identification of helium-like hydrogen spectra and ultra-dense hydrogen as Binuclear Atoms has a strong impact on one of the main objections to Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR): the overcoming of the Coulomb barrier thus identifying a sound mechanism for the occurrence of LENR. This work is not conclusive. The only goal of this work is to focus the attention of people interested in LENR mechanism on this subject, and encourage them to take this hypothesis more seriously.",,,,,,

The problem of supercompression of a solid target to a collapse state is considered. The basic principles of construction and the parameters of an experimental setup ensuring such a supercompression are described. The model and method of creation and evolution of superheavy nuclear clusters with 250<A<500 and A>3000-5000 in the controlled collapse zone and in the volume of a remote accumulating screen are discussed. The evolution of such clusters results in the synthesis of isotopes with 1<A<500 and with anomalous spatial distribution in the volume of a remote screen. These phenomena were interpreted on the basis of the idea of the formation of a self-organizing and self-supporting collapse of the electron-nucleus plasma under the action of a coherent driver up to a state close to the nuclear substance.,,,,,,

"This study was initiated due to the concern of some critics of LENR research that small energy changes in many H2O or D2O molecules in electrochemical cells can explain observed excess heat. More than three hundred LENR papers from 1989 to 2008 that reported excess energy were acquired and reviewed to extract quantitative results and other information. Excess energies and cell volumes were found in 17 papers. These data were used to compute eV per water molecule values. Most experiments showed excess energy outputs that would lead to ratios below the vibrational energy of water molecules at room temperature (0.04 eV/molecule). However, 65% of the papers, which reported both excess energies and cell volumes, indicated values significantly higher. The highest reported value was 42.6 eV/molecule. Eleven ratios are far beyond what is plausible for water to be the source of anomalous heat. Therefore, it is concluded that some unknown rearrangement of water molecules in many LENR experiments is not the source of excess heat.",,,,,,

Results of isotopic and elemental composition analyses of fuel and matter near the active zone of nickel–hydrogen reactors before and after experiment with the integral excess energy up to 790 MJ are presented. No significant changes in the isotopic composition of nickel or lithium were observed. A significant increase in the concentration of impurities of a number of nuclides has been observed not only in fuel but also in structural elements adjacent to the active zones of the reactors.,,,,,,

"While experimental and technological attention is focused on the operational methods for hydrogen loading in metals and on the observed anomalies with respect to well-established rules, we aim to remark that these methods and these consequences can be seen as a part of a more general problem. In fact, most of the experiments and deductions of material sciences are based on the assumption that space–time is flat and isotropic (Minkowskian). After discarding this assumption, a theory of Deformed Space Time (DST) was developed in the last decades. Following this theory, experimental results were obtained which are not predicted by the Standard Model. The DST-theory concerns the fundamental interactions and in particular the nuclear ones, that can play the main role in the observed anomalies. In order to consider a nuclear reaction as a DST-reaction, four main phenomenological features were deduced: occurrence of an energy threshold; change of atomic weight; absence of gamma radiation; anisotropic emission of nuclear particles in intense beams having a very short life span. From the experimental point of view, rather than looking for fortuitous events that produce the conditions for DST-reactions, more systematic research can be undertaken by following the above reported four general rules. In particular, the occurrence of thresholds can correspond to a latency time, required to reach the energy density necessary to deform space–time. The absence of gamma radiation cannot be considered as a sign that nuclear reactions are not present; in fact, in absence of detected gamma radiation, elements were found which were not present before the reaction. The nuclear emissions, which are anisotropic and impulsive, can be difficult to detect with the traditional methods, thus inducing incertitude on the occurring reactions. Finally, a rapid variation of energy density is an experimental common factor of DST-reactions. Thus, the DST-theory can be the leading theory in the design of the experiment and in the interpretation of its experimental results.",,,,,,

"The existence of heavy electrons is found theoretically in nano-structure clusters of disordered solids. The basis of the investigation is the electron band structures of disordered semiconductors previously determined by the author. The existence of electron energy pockets is found for the electrons in the conduction bands of these semiconductors that are nano-confining potential valleys of dimensions in the range of the primitive cell. The electron wave function of the confined electron is determined in when the electron interacts with local electrical field that is external for the energy pocket, and the average velocity of the electron is found. An expression for electron mass of an electron localized in pocket is derived. It is found that this electron mass is greater than the electron mass at rest and the confined electrons are designated heavy electrons. The possibility of interactions of protons with heavy electrons is discussed.",,,,,,

"One of our hydropower plants (Masjed - E - Soleyman, Iran) has four Francis turbines. Two units on the right side (looking downstream) share a common penstock and a common long tailrace tunnel, and the other two units on the left also share a penstock and tailrace tunnel. Upon commissioning of one unit, the hydraulic transient in the draft tube during load rejection above 75% was excessive. It was apparent that the guide vane closing law that had been adopted would result in water column separation during load rejection at full power. Tests with a slower closing rate showed that the risk of column separation was reduced, but a violent surge developed in the draft tube close to maximum over speed. The energy level and cavity volume that are produced are much more than those of regular TCB (Transient Cavitation Bubbles) experiments, and therefore, we should expect more intense effects than a regular TCB jet produces.",,,,,,

The origin of listed elements occurs with the active bacteria participation as a result of heat-generating LENR mainly by electron capture from inner atomic layers without additional external expenditure of energy, any radioactive materials or hard radiation. This allows us to naturally explain the emergence in nodules of stable isotopes of many elements which are really present there.",,,,,,

"The production and detection of neutrons in the so called ""cold fusion"" phenomena is claimed since the first announcement by Fleischmann and Pons in 1989. In the last twenty years the same claim has",,,,,,
"been made by other authors despite they were operating under different experimental conditions. However, most of the scientific community is yet sceptic about the actual emission of neutrons from events that in a more general statement are known as ""low energy nuclear reactions in condensed matter"" (CMNS) and the methods adopted by the various authors are often subjected to several criticisms. Indeed CMNS phenomena are rather complex and relate with several different subjects so synergy among various experts is necessary. Among these subjects, neutron detections requires a particular care and expertise because the measurements are carried out with a very low signal to noise ratio. In this paper a very brief review of the main physical laws and basic detection principles for neutrons are addressed. It is not in the author’s intention to investigate whether or not neutrons are actually emitted in CMNS phenomena, however, some tips that could allow to unambiguous measurement of neutrons from a CMNS type experiment will be addressed too.",,,,,,

"Various recently reported ""break even"" in different types of ""cold fusion"" experiments have a common physical origin if one assumes that one should add, in dense states, the action of magnetic interactions of oriented nuclear spins to the usual Coulomb forces. In that case one is led to predict a) the existence of new ""tight"" quantum molecular states (associated to new ""tight"" Bohr orbits) which correspond to the emission of X--ray lines and excess energy b) the associated apparition of a certain amount of nuclear fusion reactions due to those magnetic interactions and enhanced tunneling by strong electron concentrations. They appear in the form of neutron (or ?) bursts and various types of ""ashes"" of particular nuclear fusion reactions in electrolysis, glow discharge, capillary devices, resonance sonoluminescence and plasma discharge experiments. They both contribute to observable energy excess in amounts which vary which chosen set-ups.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"To explore this assumption two experiments are presented here i.e. 1) discharge experiments in plasma focus and ""capillary fusion"" devices (i.e. nuclear fusion) of 10^8 neutrons/burst 2) X-ray measurements in deuterium plasma focus which confirm the existence of new Bohr orbits.",,,,,,

For gamma-ray measurement, a NaI detector was used. For tritium concentration measurement in gas phase, a gas proportional chamber was fabricated and operated in low background level. The signals of those detectors were fed to Pulse Height Analyzer and recorded as energy spectra which were carefully compared with background spectra.

"Recent research activity at ENEA, in the field of Condensed Matter Nuclear Science, has been oriented to material science and Laser triggering in order to increase the reproducibility of excess of power production during loading of palladium with deuterium. Isoperibolic calorimetry in gas phase, isoperibolic and flow calorimetry with electrochemical systems have been carried out. Nuclear ashes detection was done by means of high resolution and high sensitivity mass spectrometer. Material science studies allowed to obtain a palladium showing high solubility for hydrogen isotopes and giving deuterium concentration at equilibrium larger than 0.95 (as D/Pd atomic fraction) with a reproducibility larger than 90%. Excess of power production by using the above-mentioned material achieves a reproducibility up to 30% without triggering. Laser irradiation with a proper polarization seems to have a significant role in further increasing of the excess of power production reproducibility. Heat bursts exhibit an integrated energy at least 10 times greater than the sum of all possible chemical reactions within a closed cell. The energy gain calculated at the end of the experiments is observed with deuterium but not with hydrogen. Preliminary measurements give a 4He signal in reasonable agreement with the expected values by assuming a D + D = 4He + heat (24 MeV for event) reaction.",,,,,,

When combined with other evidence for tritium formation, these argue for the existence of solid state nuclear processes in this system. Compared with previous work, effects are only seen at a relatively low level, and they appear to decrease with decreasing electrode surface/volume ratio. They are also observed in a sealed cell with internal gas recombination, which requires no thermodynamic corrections. The effect of lithium ion is seen to be specific, and the effect seems to involve only the palladium surface layers.",,,,,,

Using this cathode, the authors confirmed the sustained production of a significantly abnormal amount of energy over a period of several months that could not be ascribed to chemical reaction energy. The chemical reaction energy of 0.1 [mol] Pd-black used is only 4[kJ], but more than 200[MJ] of excess energy was continuously produced for over 3000 [hr] at an average rate of 50-100 [kJ/hr] using a DS-cathode with a same quantity of Pd-black. Intermittent operation over a period of two years using this structure proved the complete reproducibility of these results.",,,,,,

"Abstract: It was confirmed that nanometer-sized metal powder (atom clusters or simply clusters) can absorb an extremely large amount of deuterium/hydrogen atoms more than 300% against the number density of host metal. Within such clusters, the bonding potential widely changes from the center region to peripheral ones, so that the zig-zag atom-chains are always formed dynamically around the average position of atoms and the degree of filling up of the constituent atoms for the fcc type metal reduces to about 0.64 from 0.74 in bulk metal, i.e., vacant space increases to 0.36 from 0.26. As a result, a large amount of deuterium/hydrogen atoms are instantly dissolved into such host-clusters at room temperature. . . .",,,,,,

"Based on the functioning of Pd black inside a DS-Cathode, which has produced irrefutable evidence for the existence of solid nuclear fusion, new materials were developed to absorb abundant D/H atoms, up to levels as high as 300% of Pd number.

(1) Either excess energy or helium of the ZrNiPd powder is always about ten times higher than that of the ZrPd powder.,,,,,,
"(2) By using the weight 16 [g] of the ZrNiPd powder, the excess power 4 [watt] lasted stably for one hour, only less than one gram palladium was consumed. Its cost is lower than the ZrPd powder. We choose the ZrNiPd powder as a good material for the solid fusion.",,,,,,
"(3) The concentration of helium was very successful. These results indicate that the reacted gas of ""solid nuclear fusion"" can serve as a source of helium production.",,,,,,

(Both of the energy and helium generation affected by the reactor structure, gas flow rate, powder weight, and cooling condition were studied.) Deuterium gas loading processes of two types of nano material (ZrO2Pd35 and ZrO2Ni30Pd5) were studied respectively in this paper. The results showed the energy produced in ZrNiPd powder is higher than in ZrPd powder. Helium as an important evidence of solid-state fusion was detected by mass analyzer ""QMS"". As results, ""Solid Fusion"" has been confirmed by the helium existence.",,,,,,

"The phenomena that take place when some b.c.c, metals are cathodically charged with hydrogen are being studied by x-ray diffraction, and some preliminary results and a plausible explanation have been reported (i). Briefly, the lattice parmeter calculated from Bragg peaks obtained from diffraction by metal near the surface of the sheet opposite the charging surface increases at a rate that is extremely low in view of the known diffusivity of hydrogen in the metal. In addition, different Bragg reflections lead to different values of lattice parameters and to different time dependencies; also, grain rotation occurs. The suggested mechanism for these phenomena involves large amounts of plastic deformation caused by stress generation caused by hydrogen concentration gradients. We report here an additional phenomenon that occurs in thin metal films sputtered upon a much thicker metal substrata when the latter is cathodically charged with hydrogen. A provisional explanation is offered.",,,,,,

Ti-30Mo plates (where the composition is given in approximate weight per cent) is found to generate dislocations at which the hydrogen atoms are trapped during their diffusion across the metal thickness. The defect generation is a result of stresses arising from the hydrogen concentration gradient at the entry surface. The generation of dislocations occurs on initiating the charging and persists thereafter with emission of dislocations towards the far side of the plate. As a consequence, slip lines and subgrains are formed at the entry and far sides. . . .",,,,,,

"The objective of this workshop was to explore compelling R&D opportunities in Low-Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR) [1], in support of developing metrics for a potential ARPA-E R&D program in LENR. Despite a large body of empirical evidence for LENR that has been reported internationally over the past 30+ years in both published and unpublished materials, as well as multiple books, there still does not exist a widely accepted, on-demand, repeatable LENR experiment nor a sound theoretical basis. This has led to a stalemate where adequate funding is not accessible to establish irrefutable evidence and understanding of LENR, and lack of the latter precludes the field from accessing adequate funding. Building on and leveraging the most promising recent developments in LENR research, ARPA-E envisions a potential two-phase approach toward breaking this stalemate . . .",,,,,,

"Studies on several kinds of palladium cathodes have been conducted using electrochemical cells using LiOD/D20 electrolyte to necessary and sufficient conditions for attaining high deuterium loading. Comparative observations of microstructure and analysis of surface impurities have been carried out on palladium specimens with various pre-electrolysis treatments. Single crystal samples of Pd absorbed deuterium rather slowly, but nevertheless reached comparatively high 0.89 D/Pd loading ratio. Many fine slip band structures were observed on the surface, and several micro-cracks existed in the crystal of post electrolysis specimens. High purity (>99.99%) polycrystalline Pd samples with surface purification treatment such as annealing at 850-1000 C in ultrahigh vacuum, also showed high (0.91 in max.) loading characteristics. Thermal etching effects were observed on the surface of annealed specimens at higher temperatures and high vacuum conditions. Surface microcracks along the grain boundaries as well as blistering of the electrode surface were observed in some cases. Surface impurities analysis showed that Li atoms penetrate into the Pd cathode to a depth of several hundred to a thousand Angstroms from the surface. From these observations and analysis of various processed and treated Pd specimens, the material characteristics of Pd cathode achieving high loading ratio are discussed.",,,,,,

"Abstract We have presumed that achieving high reproducibility of the anomalous effect may depend upon reproducible high loading ratios of deuterium in the Palladium. By modification of the working process, heat treatment, surface treatment, and the electrolysis conditions, the deuterium loading up to 0.9~0.96 was achieved with relatively high reproducibility. Detail features of the loading and deloading process were observed by gas chromatographic (GC) analysis and by in-situ optical micrographs during electrolysis. Crystal phase and lattice parameter changes were also measured to find any new phase by the in-situ X-ray diffraction system which was newly developed at the NHE-Lab. The phase transition of α-β during the loading and unloading process was well identified, however no new phase was observed up to a loading ratio of about 0.90.",,,,,,

"Following the previous study of the state of deuterium atoms in the titanium crystal (J. Condensed Matter Nucl. Sci. 5 ( 2011 ) 7), in this paper, the authors have analyzed the state of the deuterium atom in a tetrahedron cage, using the first principle molecular orbital calculation. In the simulation analysis of the tetrahedron cage, it is indicated that the titanium pair causes the deuterium atom to have ligancy 2 in the cage with two hydrogen atoms. If neutron generation occurs, we can deduce from the past experimental results that it occurs after a small increase of kinetic energy of deuterium atoms. This suggests that the quantity of neutron generated may increase if we can give kinetic energy to the adsorbed deuterium atoms in the titanium crystal by another means other than a temperature rise, at a suitable temperature and pressure. The authors propose a new experimental apparatus which appears to promote and increase the neutron generation.",,,,,,

"In this paper, the authors have intended to ascertain the driving force for an adsorbed deuterium atom or a deuteron to collide in titanium crystal. Recent simulation analysis results, related to the predicted cluster or cell models of deuterium atoms adsorbed in titanium crystal, together with the related calculations by Coulomb formula and Yukawa formula were investigated. Coulomb force working between deuteron–deuteron (d–d) particles is compared with the nuclear force working between them. The change of the force to each of them is evaluated in accordance with the distance between them, near the surface of the atomic nucleus. Taking into account the results of previous studies, it seems that nuclear fusion will occur occasionally without adding any specified energy. We think that there is a possibility of a collision of free deuterons through the medium of a negative charge in a deuterium atom in ligancy 2. On the other hand, we think that if a suitable amount of energy, which is far smaller than that of high temperature nuclear fusion, such as the irradiation of the alternative electromagnetic wave, for example, is supplied to adsorbed deuterium atoms and desorbed deuterons in the titanium (Ti) shavings packed in the experimental cylinder under a pressurized or evacuation condition with a suitable temperature rise, then there also will be a higher probability of nuclear fusion being achieved.",,,,,,

"In a previous paper, the Coulomb and nuclear forces between deuteron–deuteron (d–d) particles using the Coulomb formula and the Yukawa formula were calculated and compared. The force of each of them was evaluated in accordance with the distance between them, near the surface of an atomic nucleus. As a result, it was found that there were two regions. One of them is the stronger Coulomb force region and the other is the stronger nuclear force region. At the boundary of these regions, both forces are equal to each other. It appears that if the adsorbed deuterium atom in ligancy 2 and the desorbed free deuteron are placed in a suitable magnetic field, both the electron in the adsorbed deuterium atom in ligancy 2 and the desorbed free deuteron are influenced by the magnetic lines of force. The author deemed that there might be an aperture of the energy barrier. If there is the aperture of such an energy barrier, there must be a possibility for two deuterium nuclei to collide and produce nuclear fusion without being under tremendous high temperatures. To confirm this possibility, the author has studied and evaluated the behavior of the charged particle and calculated the working force under the homogeneous and stable magnetic field. As an example, under this influence in the magnetic field, the working force, the behavior of a deuteron, a co-existing deuteron and an adsorbed deuterium atom in ligancy have been analyzed. However, the working force to the particle, the Lorentz force, is very small compared to the Coulomb force. The motion of the charged particle and the electron orbital plane in an adsorbed deuterium atom in ligancy 2 in the magnetic field is the preferable direction. To analyze the possibility of nuclear fusion at room temperature, it is thought that a more advantageous circumstance than that proposed in this paper should be prepared.",,,,,,

"In this study, we applied a variety of palladium pretreatment methods, including nitric acid etching, Aqua regia etching and electrochemical oxidation/reduction to determine the effect of cathode initial condition on hydrogen absorption into palladium during the loading process. The electrochemical behavior of palladium was characterized using electrochemical permeation, electrochemical desorption, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The hydrogen diffusion coefficient in palladium membrane was obtained using the time-lag method. The lattice diffusivity of hydrogen as well as the amounts and distribution of the diffused and trapped hydrogen were analyzed using the desorption rate of hydrogen. We also investigated the effect of pyridine, a permeation promoter on hydrogen absorption in palladium membranes. Electrochemical parameters of double layer capacitance, charge transfer resistance and surface roughness were characterized using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy for both treated and untreated cathodes. This study shows that the ability to load Pd with hydrogen is only mildly affected by surface pretreatment and the chemical additives, and therefore, we consider the pretreatments a second order effect regarding the ability to load.",,,,,,

"After the claimed experimental evidence of deuteron cold fusion reported in the literature, a large amount of theoretical work has been done, either to support the possibility of this unexpected phenomenon, either to present arguments against it. The paper by Legget and Baym appears of fundamental relevance to this respect. In that work a rigorous upper bound is given for the fusion rate of deuterons embedded in a crystal, which is too small to be compatible with the claimed experimental values. The upper bound is expressed mainly in terms of the chemical potential of neutral helium atoms and deuteron molecules with respect to a crystal of Palladium, or in general of the absorbing material. The smallness of this upper bound is a consequence of the small value of the chemical potential of neutral helium atoms. The latter has been taken to be close to zero, according to the experimental evidence. . . .",,,,,,

"Concentration polarization present in any membrane separation affects the system performance depending on the membrane permeance, i.e., a higher permeance leads to a higher polarization. Hydrogen transport in Pd-based supported membranes was described by means of a model [1] considering several elementary steps of the permeation process, improving what done by Ward and Dao for self-supported membranes. The model includes the external mass transfer in the multicomponent gaseous phases on both membrane sides, described by the Stefan-Maxwell equations. The transport of the multicomponent mixture in the multilayered porous support was also considered and described by means of the Dusty Gas Model, which takes into account Knudsen, Poiseuille and ordinary diffusion. . . .",,,,,,

"Scientists worldwide have been quietly investigating low-energy nuclear reactions (LENR) for the past 20 years. Researchers in this controversial field are now claiming paradigm-shifting results, including generation of large amounts of excess heat, nuclear activity and transmutation of elements. Although no current theory exists to explain all the reported phenomena, some scientists now believe quantum-level nuclear reactions may be occurring. DIA assesses with high con fidence that if LENR can produce nuclear-origin energy at room temperatures, this disruptive technology could revolutionize energy production and storage, since nuclear reactions release millions of times more energy per unit mass than do any known chemical fuel.",,,,,,

"Noting Dr. Parmenter's acknowledgment to me at the end of his seminal paper, Dr. Mallove has asked me for a prefatory critique. Frankly I feel like a kindergarten finger-painting dauber asked to appraise a Rembrandt! In fact, in 1994 I applied seriously for a humble programmer's job at the Univ. of Arizona in hopes that by moving to Tucson I might be able to audit some of Parmenter's courses: I am awed by his mastery of the three-dimensional details, not only of Quantum Mechanics (QM) [which I know only as a 1-D point-particle theory] but of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), Nuclear Physics, and Solid-State Physics. I accepted this assignment only in hopes of nudging people like Dr. Barry Merriman of UCLA and Dr. Jim Peebles of Princeton to consider Parmenter's contributions with the serious care which they manifestly deserve. I'd also hope that in the next issue of IE we receive comments on this milestone theoretical tour de force by all of the dozen other expert theoreticians mentioned below.",,,,,,

"The 1993 point-particle, 1-D semi-classical quantum-mechanical theory of resonant transparency of the Coulomb barrier [1], though admittedly crude, has some plausibility as to relevance and adequacy because it predicts quantitatively different results for lattices of protons versus deuterons embedded in host lattices of palladium versus nickel. Specifically it predicts that cold fusion is likely with Ni cathodes and electrolysis with either ordinary or heavy water, whereas it is likely only for heavy-water electrolysis with Pd cathodes. The question of whether or not this 1993 theory has any predictive power regarding the 2003 Letts-Cravens effect is considered and answered as: ""partially."" That is, the ""optimal"" range of wavelengths includes that discovered by Letts and Cravens, but because of the possibility of multi-photon reactions it does not uniquely single out their 680 nm as best, which would require a more detailed model (including e.g. cathode temperature) than provided by the simplified 1993 theory.",,,,,,

"It is universally accepted, even by nonscientists, that if the measured output from a physical system is double, triple, or quadruple that obtained when the measured stimulus/input is doubled, tripled, or quadrupled then there is a ""cause and effect relationship"" between the input and output (e.g. total energy input versus excess energy [or nuclear ash] output in a cold fusion experiment). How does one quantify this scientifically, when random process disturbances and random measurement noises preclude perfect linearity? This question is answered under the assumption of Gaussian (or ""normal"") departures from ideal linearity regarding t hetwo mentioned statistical aspects. This is a generalization of the protocol propose dby Bass [1], which is more realistically flexible in several respects. An arbitrary number N >= 3 of similarly prepared samples is allowed, and neither the voltage nor the current is required to be constant. However, the previous protocol may be recovered as a special case when N = 5.",,,,,,

Possible calorimetric diagnostics and nuclear radiation (gamma rays, X-rays, and neutrons) were monitored. Liquid scintillation diagnostics of tritium were used. Gamma-ray radiation detection with an NaI scintillation detector, and X-ray radiation detection with Geiger counters was performed. No such radiation was observed. Excess heat was not detected in any experiment. Neutrons were measured with help of 3He counters placed in a paraffin barrel. Small neutron emissions (up to 100 neutrons) was observed in the form of a series of short bursts (lasting a few milliseconds) during some minutes at the background level. The generation of tritium after LED lamp and matrix of LEDs irradiation of water solutions LiOH and Na2CO3has been demonstrated in some experiments.",,,,,,

In 1989 the University of Utah announced a new experiment by electrochemists Professors Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons that demonstrates table top nuclear fusion at extremely low levels, and substantial anomalous (unexplained, excess) heat energy (power) with no dangerous radiation. This story, written for the college reader without scientific training, presents the abundant replication of excess heat results by many laboratories in several countries. Excess heat research, referred to as cold fusion research, is presently an empirical science known as low energy nuclear reactions (LENR). While the book illustrates much progress, the specific reactions that produce the heat energy still await discovery. . .",,,,,,

Remaining largely anonymous, they studied a collection of papers about the field selected and prepared by several of the scientists who have been active in CFR for the past sixteen y ears. Those scientists also presented selected accomplishments to some of the Reviewers during a one day meeting. The following three questions (paraphrased) were asked of the Reviewers: (1) Is there evidence of low-energy-nuclear-reactions (LENR), (2) do such reactions really occur, and (3) should research efforts be continued?",,,,,,

Experimental work was undertaken to reproduce a specific observation of the gas-phase Anomalous Heat Effect (AHE)*. This task required the production of a quantity of heat energy by a mass of material so small that the origin of the energy cannot be attributable to a chemical process. The gas-phase form of AHE is difficult to reproduce and hence lacks a measure of credibility. The goal is to enhance its credibility by reproducing results first demonstrated in Japan and later reproduced in the U.S. by a solitary investigator. The technique heated nanometer-sized Ni:Pd particles (20:1 molar ratio) embedded in micron-sized particles of an inert refractory of ZrO2. It was not within the purview of this work to investigate the physical origin of the AHE effect or speculate on its source.,,,,,,

Instrumentation developed to measure heat power from a high-temperature reactor for experimental trials lasting several weeks is being applied to gas-phase Ni/H2 LENR. We developed a reactor that can maintain and record temperatures in excess of 1200° C while monitoring pressures exceeding 7 bar. This reactor is inserted into a flowing-fluid calorimeter that allows both temperature rise and flow rate of the cooling fluid to be redundantly measured by different physical principles. A computerized data acquisition system was written to automate the collection of more than 20 physical parameters with simultaneous numerical and dual graphical displays comprising both a strip chart and complete history of key parameters. Initial studies of the absorption of light hydrogen (H2) by nickel are presented.,,,,,,

"At present, mechanical characterisation of engineered surfaces is gaining more and more interest for the growing industrial application of surface modification and coating techniques, which are usually applied to improve either surface mechanical or functional performances (i.e hardness, load bearing capacity, wear resistance, surface free energy and chemical reactivity, electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity, . . .).",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"Furthermore, it has to be considered that the development of nanostructured materials and the growing use and application of nano-systems and nano-structures make the use of advanced procedures for nano-scale mechanical characterisation strictly necessary; in other cases, mechanical behaviour can be strongly influenced by microstructural and size effects (grain size, defects, interfaces, porosity,…), so multi-scale characterisation procedures are strongly needed for a determination of the correct correlation function among process parameters, surface properties and in-service performances.",,,,,,

,,,,,,
"This work aims to develop a ""family"" of low-powered calorimetrically-accurate glow discharge units, similar to that reported by Dardik, et al. at ICCF-10, and to use these to test a wide range of cathode materials, electrode coatings, gas types, gas pressures, and power input levels. We will describe the design and calibration of these units.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"The strategy is to use a large number of very similar units so that the calorimetric response does not vary significantly for a given power level. The design is metal or sealed glass cylindrical tubes, charged with 0.4 to 50 torr mixtures of deuterium, hydrogen, argon, or helium gases. Units operate from 0.2 watt to >2 watt power input. The units have low mass (<400 grams) to enhance their sensitivity to excess heat, and they are designed to allow visual observation of the discharge, on-line spectroscopic analysis of the gas to follow any changes in composition, and replication of the geometry and thermal mass during numerous changes in electrode composition. . . .",,,,,,

INTRODUCTION,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"The origin of the excess heat developed during the electrolysis of heavy water in ""Cold Fusion"" cells is up to now open to question. The necessary presence of deuterium suggests that fusion reactions can be partially or totally responsible for the generation of excess heat.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
Experience has shown neutron emission to be sporadic and very weak; on the other hand tritium was found in small but detectable amounts. Moreover if tritium accumulates in the solution it can be comfortably measured postmortem.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Two experimental campaigns were performed:,,,,,,
,,,,,,
The first one in Frascati having as main objective the detection of tritium excess. Particular care was exerted to avoid any tritium and hydrogen contamination.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"The second one at the Texas A & M University in the framework of a scientific collaboration, having as objective the excess of heat and tritium measurement.",,,,,,

"The production of heat excess (HE) in electrolytic cells with heavy water and palladium cathodes is, in cold fusion, the experiment that has had more confirmations, even though still doubts are cast on its nuclear origin. Furthermore, the correlation of HE with some features of the experiment seemed to be well established, the most convincing of which is the threshold of the D/Pd ratio. What is yet not quite clear is how to obtain a high D/Pd ratio, since this feature seems to depend both on the material and on the procedures adopted for the electrolysis. In this paper we will propose a novel approach to this problem, which permits us to correlate HE with other features of the experiment. In particular, we try to study the transport of matter across the palladium lattice during the electrolysis. A model proposed by two of us (ADN and VV), and presented at this Conference, helps to interpret the experimental results, and gives interesting hints for future research.",,,,,,

"In recent years the photothermal techniques have been successfully applied to investigate the thermal properties of solid samples subjected to a surface treatment [ 1 ] . In many cases the treatment causes a microstructural change and, consequently, a change of the surface thermal properties. In the pal1adium-hydrogen compounds the loading process generates both a high hydrogen concentration and a high concentration gradient at the surface which creates a stress field [2] . Such a situation could inhibit the heat conduction and diffusion because of the production of defects and dislocations [3]. In this sense the thermal diffusivity may be correlated to the hydrogen concentration providing a supplementary information about the quality of the loading processes.",,,,,,

"ABSTRACT A palladium foil cathode, 50 mm in diameter, 100 µm thick is placed between two anodic palladium foils of same dimensions. A proton conductor layer (poly-ethyleneoxide) (PEO) and phosphoric acid) is deposited between the cathode and the two anodes. The system is placed in a chamber filled with deuterium gas, at a temperature of 75°C. At first, deuterium fills the two anodes up to D/Pd = 0.48 measured by pressure decrease. Then a voltage is applied between cathode and anodes, and the cathode gets loaded by D+ electrochemical migration through the solid state electrolyte. Correspondingly, the pressure decreases. Loadings of up to 0.73 have been obtained. When voltages are reversed, the cathode deloads, and the pressure in the chamber increases. This method is well suited to measure over-potentials and absolute loadings. The input power is very low, since the production of D+ ions entering the cathode is close to 100% whereas in liquid electrolyte cells, a small fraction of the ions produced is absorbed by the cathode. Therefore excess heat measurement is easily detected.",,,,,,

"The discovery of ""Cold Fusion"" has been announced officially by a press conference on March 23rd 1989 at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. The shock wave produced by the Pons and Fleischmann announcement is probably unique in history, due to the fact that emails and fax machines helped propagate the good and the bad news altogether at light speed. Hundreds laboratories around the world immediately tried to replicate the experiment. However, details of it were not well known and doing electrochemistry and calorimetry altogether is a difficult art and takes time to master. Therefore most nuclear scientists tried to detect the assumed accompanying radiations produced by the well known reaction D+D producing either He-3 and a neutron or tritium and a proton with equal probability.",,,,,,

The experiment consists usually of a palladium tube 10 cm long, 2mm outer diameter with 200 μm thick walls, and closed at one end. Deuterium gas is introduced in the tube at various pressures, and temperatures and diffuses out through the walls of the tube. The tube, heated by a resistor, is positioned inside a reactor cell which is a small vacuum chamber. The reactor cell is positioned inside a second vacuum chamber. The outer walls of the vacuum chamber are water cooled. Thermal energy is determined by measuring inlet and outlet temperatures and water mass flow. The energy yield of this calorimeter is 95-98 % depending on input power.",,,,,,

"Following the work by several researchers we have undertaken experiments with deuterium gas flowing through the walls of a palladium tube. Tubes were heated at various temperatures and either filled with palladium powder or palladium compounds or empty. Our mass flow calorimeter enables us to accurately measure excess heat production. We usually used palladium tubes 10 cm long, 2 mm outer diameter with 200 Âµm thick walls, and closed at one end. Deuterium gas is introduced in the tube at various pressures, and temperatures and diffuses out through the walls of the tube. Thermal energy is determined by measuring inlet and outlet temperatures of cooling water and its mass flow. The energy yield of this calorimeter is 95-98% depending on input power. Our best result so far is an excess heat of 3 W with an input power of 47 W using an oxidized palladium tube filled with palladium powder. In addition to these results we describe an experiment where temperature oscillations have been measured, indicating the importance of temperature in excess heat production.",,,,,,

"Seventeen years after the announcement by Professors Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann of the discovery of cold fusion in March 1989, the scientific community does not acknowledge this field as a genuine scientific research theme. However, the scientific demonstration of cold fusion was made long ago by showing the evidence of excess heat production in electrolytic cells and other devices. Also, nuclear ashes have been observed, mainly the formation of helium-4 along with the production of excess heat. What makes this field difficult to accept is the lack of the usual particle emission observed in nuclear science or high-energy physics. In some instances low-level neutron production, X-ray emission and transmutation of elements have been measured. At this point there is no satisfactory theory explaining the unique characteristics of condensed matter nuclear science. Many models have been proposed, several of them using textbook physics.",,,,,,

"While running an electrochemical cell designed to measure excess heat with a hollow palladium cathode and a platinum wire anode in heavy water, an explosion occurred. The Dewar that contained the experiment shattered. It is unlikely that the explosion was due to a deuterium oxygen recombination explosive reaction, since the cell was open, the amount of deuterium and oxygen gas was very limited in the cell and any pressure created by recombination should have escaped through the unsealed open end of the cell. It is very likely that under some not yet understood conditions, chain reactions occur in highly loaded palladium samples giving rise to an explosion. Several experimentalists before have already observed this same phenomenon.",,,,,,

"The paper, ""Cold Fusion from a Chemist’s Point of View,"" is divided in two parts. In the first part, Storms explains the difference between hot fusion and cold fusion. The mechanisms of hot fusion and cold fusion cannot be the same. For example, in fractofusion the mechanism is identical to hot fusion (it is not LENR), and the reaction products are the same as those of hot fusion. Cold fusion operates under a different mechanism. Storms assumes that hot fusion operates under the basic laws of thermodynamics which explain the data observed. On the other hand, cold fusion operates under the laws of statistics. This is the explanation of the different behaviors between hot and cold fusion. . . .",,,,,,

"This paper demonstrates that during cold fusion experiments by electrolysis of heavy water with palladium cathodes, there is production of silver. By Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy, it is shown that silver detected is not due to contamination, but probably to transmutation of palladium by absorption of a deuterium nucleus, because only the 107Ag-isotope is present, and not 109Ag, as in natural silver. Another important result of this study is the determination of the depth at which the reaction occurs: 1.3 microm below the cathode surface.",,,,,,

,,,,,,
"Many experiments and charging palladium with deuterium, either electrolytically or by gas absorption, indicate a production of fast neutrons or other products of d-d fusion reactions accompanying the charging process under special, hitherto not fully understood conditions, see e.g. Ref. [1]. These results need further work towards experimental confirmation and understanding of underlying physical processes.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"At the Dresden University of Technology after a first experiment confirming a very small neutron production during electrolytic charging the palladium cathodes with deuterium further studies of the phenomenon of nuclear fusion in condensed matter work carried out, which systematically hint at a week neutron production as a typical function of the period of charging.",,,,,,

An account is given of the massive production of tritium at a Pd electrode. Production continued for ~ 750 hours after which time it was arbitrarily curtailed. Production of T was found to cease every few days but could be resuscitated by increasing the overpotential of the electrode reaction. A logarithmic relation between the rate of tritium production and the overpotential of the electrode reaction was established. The Will-Cedzynska method of examining T contamination in specimens has shown that nothing above the background of T was detected if no D2O had been electrolytically evolved on the Pd specimens concerned.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Helium production was found to accompany that of T. The He was analyzed by thermal expulsion and mass spectroscopy. No He3 was found but He4 was measured in nine specimens out of ten examined. Voids were also detected - 1 micron within the electrode. The excess tritium production on Pd co-deposited with deuterium was found.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Cracking and spreading of cracks is shown. An attempt was made to calculate the amount of hydrogen trapped in cracks and to calculate the standard free energy of trapping.,,,,,,

"INTRODUCTION: THE SITUATION IN MARCH, 1989",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"The firm opinion in respect to basic knowledge of the nucleus common among chemists and physicists in March, 1989, was that chemical effects (involving frequencies of ~ 10^14, could not affect the nucleus of atoms with frequencies ~ 10^6 times higher. It was also believed in March, 1989, that high energy neutrons were the path towards atomic fission, as in nuclear reactors; and that collisions of H isotopes at extremely high temperatures similar to those in the sun, constituted the main path towards the fusion of nuclei. . . .",,,,,,

"The generally accepted idea is that the paper of Fleischmann, Pons, and Hawkins of 1989 gave the first evidence that nuclear reactions occur in the cold in a palladium-deuterium (Pd-D) electrolysis system. However, published accounts on elemental change in solids have been around since before the discovery of the nucleus. Thus, the earliest evidence for creation of new elements was that reported for reactions in biological systems. In view of the wave of negative opinion against the 1989 and thereafter work, it is interesting to note a U.S. Army report of 1978 which concluded that the evidence for nuclear reactions in biology was strongly positive. Even less well-known is that U.S. government labs in the 1970s experimented with neutron emission arising from the passage of very high currents through wires, conditions under which thermonuclear reactions should not have been occurring.",,,,,,

CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE FIELD OF LOW TEMPERATURE NUCLEAR REACTIONS FROM GROUPS AT TEXAS A&M,,,,,,
"Directly after the March 1989 TV announcement by Fleischmann and Pons that they had achieved a nuclear reaction at electrodes in the cold, research began on the phenomenon at Texas A&M. The University was picked by EPRI as a recipient of funds to investigate the field. Thus, it possessed a Thermodynamic Research Center, a Cyclotron group, and three groups in Electrochemistry (Chemistry Department). In addition, there was the Center for Electrochemical Systems and Hydrogen Research in the Texas Engineering Experiment Center, housed in the university. All these groups received funds to explore ""cold fusion.""",,,,,,

I was a physical chemist and my contact with nuclear chemistry was only in using it in some tracer techniques. The Fleischmann and Pons announcement of March 1989 was of interest partly because of its radical nature, but also because I had known Martin Fleischmann since his days as a student at the Imperial College of Science and Technology in London. I had easy access to Fleischmann and I therefore could instruct my co-workers (about 20 at the time) about the technique used in the Fleischmann and Pons work.",,,,,,

"Both hydrogen and deuterium in their electrolysis on palladium gave linear Tafel lines but each had a kink in it at about 0.35 V overpotential (η). At this value damage begins to be seen in the SEM photographs of the interior of the electrodes. Tritium formation became detectable at an overpotential (η) of about 0.4 V. The reaction occurs in two consecutive steps: the first is a Volmer-Tafel reaction which occurs when the overpotential is less than 0.3 V. But as the measured coverage θD approaches unity, the deuterons begin to discharge onto the adsorbed deuterium (Heyrovsky mechanism). The second (consecutive) step leads to the tritium formation via a neutron transfer from the electrode to the Pd-D bond which at this stage (near to full occupancy by D) is relatively weak. The ready availability of neutrons in the surface region of the metal catalyst is rationalized in terms of the high electron concentration associated with the surface and he presence of D arriving from D2O in the solution: e- + D+ = 2 neutrons + a neutrino. The model is applied to two anomalies which have troubled this reaction. One is irreproducibility and also the long time (100 h or more) before any nuclear activity is seen.",,,,,,

Bockris and Mallove [2] published in 1999 a survey of earlier nuclear reactions in the cold (later condensed matter nuclear reactions). Included in their list was a publication by two Italian engineers Speri and Zorzi [3] which came out in 1989. Drawn by this latter fact, in 2011, I investigated further the Speri and Zorzi paper which Mallove and I had mentioned with only a publication date. I found the paper in an obscure medium and discovered upon being able to read it that Speri and Zorzi had been awarded an Italian patent in 1978. The patent was awarded for the discovery of the fusion of hydrogen isotopes to form helium. The original work was carried out in 1974.",,,,,,

"The typical electrochemical cell consists of four potentials. One of these is spurious: it should be eliminated from the measurement. A method of doing this is described. The major recommendation is that a third or, so called reference electrode, should be involved in all measurements from which structural information is to be taken from the working electrode. This is then attached to the reference electrode and a high resistance volt meter measures the potential of the working electrode with respect to the reference electrode. Alternative reference electrodes are described.",,,,,,

"After receiving a Ph.D. Degree from Imperial College, Fleischmann (F) went to work in the University of Newcastle in the U.K. and spent productive years there (metal deposition, micro-electrodes, and electrochemical extraction from mixtures metals). His reputation grew at a time (1950-1960) when electrochemistry was a popular subject for university research. British Electricity saw their chance to get a star performer down to Southampton University as professor, so they paid for a chair for a person who could attract research support and found that F could fill the job, although it was open to other candidates. Fleischmann occupied the chair for only a few years, less than had been foreseen, and retired from university life some years before it is usual. By this time he already was a Fellow of the Royal Society and also a director of the Max Planck Institute in Berlin. Fleischmann made a colleague of Stanley Pons, head of the Chemistry Department in the University in Utah. Pons (P) was of independent means and could fund research which the two of them might think out together. Fusion means coming together and F saw in electrochemistry a high performance way whereby this might be done. What they found was that the heat evolved in a particular deuterium solution when they passed current through it was larger than it should have been according to known chemical theory. In addition to this they observed some neutrons. They suggested that the extra heat was due to an unknown nuclear reaction. What was unusual about the next step was that F&P got on the McNeil-Lehrer Hour and announced that they had been the first to carry out a nuclear reaction in the cold. After a short time, the nuclear chemists of the world turned against F&P and said that their claims must be all nonsense. The anti-Fleischmann opinion expressed at meetings was so great that they decided that it would be a good thing to escape to some other country. They had a friendship with a very wealthy man, Mr. Toyota, and he had already founded some laboratories in the South of France. He offered F and P laboratory space there and they could move their operation to it free of the negative atmosphere which reigned in America. At first the news which came from the laboratory in France was good. Alas, this was not maintained and after two years they split up and P retired to live in France whilst F retired to Tisbury in the U.K. But F’s creativity would not lie down and he was soon to apply something new, Quantum Electrodynamics. He made a colleagueship with a well-known Italian physicist Preparata. However, fate was not kind to F and he discovered that he was suffering from Parkinson’s disease. This is a slow disease but it’s incurable. However, for a couple of years F continued to attend meetings and make intelligent remarks at them. He died on 3 August 2012. Was F a brilliant theorist who did not have time to realize his true vision or had Jack the Flash, his nickname, flashed too much?

"Anomalous heat generation in palladium-based materials has been studied in various active research groups since M. Fleischmann, and S. Pons demonstrated an anomalous heat in 1989. There have been attempts to explain anomalous heat by deuteron–deuteron nuclear fusion in the Pd lattice while the search for radiation was unsuccessful which indicated that the origin of the excess heat is unknown. Despite the unknown origin of the excess heat, Pd system is in the core of the research for energy production. The excess heat has been demonstrated by using calorimeters that are well characterized. However, these measurements are not able to provide detailed information about a localized heat rather than a heat from a large area. A new method is demonstrated to investigate an excess heat from Pd electrode loaded with deuterium or hydrogen. It is capable of measuring a small amount of heat generated in a localized area with a sub-micrometer resolution by fluorescence imaging with temperature sensitive fluorescence dyes. Considering quantum yield, photostability, and thermal stability, rhodamine 6G (R6G) is selected for temperature sensor along with a polymer, Poly MethylSilsesquioxane (PMSSQ). The thermal quenching of fluorescence resulted in a decreased temperature over time with heat generation. We envisioned that this new method of the temperature measurement provided a novel diagnostic tool for localized excess heat which was not detectable by calorimetry due to intrinsic disability.",,,,,,

A very simple calculation is used, which involves a bond between two inter-nucleon up and down quarks. This simple calculation does not depend on the type or mechanism for the bond. Furthermore, this simple calculation does not specify the shape or structure for the nucleus. This calculation only examines the energy of all possible up-to-down inter-nucleon bonds that may be formed within a quantum nucleus. A comparison of this total energy is made to the experimental binding energy with excellent results. The potential significance of this finding is discussed.",,,,,,

The shell model of the nuclear force is considered to be the fundamental and foundational model of the nuclear force -- that force which binds the nucleons together in a nucleus. The shell model was developed in the late 1940s, and it is based on the experimentally known nuclear data at that time, data which supported the concept of nuclear shells. Most textbooks, even the current ones, present this experimental data from the 1940s when discussing the validity of the shell model. However, a large amount of nuclear data has since been collected over the past 70 years, and a re-examination of the experimental data in support of the shell model is long overdue.",,,,,,

"This paper explores how the electromagnetic energies of the quarks within the atomic nucleus affect the behavior of the Nuclear Force. By examining the electromagnetic energies and forces, many questions about nuclear behavior can be answered, and many insights into the atomic nucleus can be gained. Previous theoretical models for the Nuclear Force include only the Coulomb electric force of the protons, but with little or no consideration of the electromagnetic characteristics of the quarks. By incorporating the electromagnetic energies and forces into nuclear theory, this model has been able to achieve predictions of binding energy better than any previous model, doing so by using only one parameter instead of the five parameters used in the semi-empirical Weizsäcker formula of the Liquid Drop Model. The Electromagnetic Model unifies the Nuclear Force to the Electromagnetic Force. The Electromagnetic Model of the Nuclear Force includes the calculation of electromagnetics of the quarks, and by doing such, it is shown that the Nuclear Force is significantly influenced by the Electromagnetic Forces of the quarks. This paper, Part II of this series, illustrates the ground state configurations of the atomic nuclei, showing the basic segments of how the protons and neutrons cluster together, and how these segments bond to form larger atomic nuclei. A pattern emerges for the ground state configurations due to the uniformity of the electromagnetic laws. Diagrams are shown for this basic pattern, for both stable and radioactive atomic nuclei. By incorporating the electromagnetic energies and forces into nuclear theory, this model has been able to achieve not only excellent predictions of binding energy, but the ability to answer many other questions regarding the various behaviors of atomic nuclei.",,,,,,

The major achievement at ICCF-6 was, to my opinion, the evidence of the corre­lation between Excess Heat, when measured, and the production of 4He, observed in quantities of the same order of magnitude of what expected form the hypothe­sis that the reaction d + d → 4He + (energy) is the main source of energy in Cold Fusion experiments. This conclusion was reached by several experiments.",,,,,,

"It has been claimed that Ni–H systems produce excess heat for long periods of time. We have performed experimental calorimetric investigations of this phenomenon. The experimental setup consisted of a ceramic reactor with nickel powder inside it, a heater, hydrogen loading system and calorimeter. Nickel powders with different grain size were used because of their large surface area. Hydrogen pressure varied from 0.5 to 2.5 atm. Temperature varied from 25 to 800?C. Different methods of input power were used in order to investigate possible effects of high amplitude magnetic pulses. The experimental runs lasted from 4 to 50 h. Experiments did not show any evidence of excess heat within the accuracy of measurement.",,,,,,

"A portable X-ray detector has been developed to complement ""cold fusion"" studies. Our reasoning is that any set of nuclear reactions which produce measurable heat must also produce abundant secondary X-rays. However, at the Nagoya meeting and elsewhere, we found that errors and uncertainties in current experiments prevent unambiguous interpretation of claims of excess-heat generation . Hence, this paper also outlines criteria for establishing calorimeter performance for definitive measurements of ""excess heat"" in cold-fusion experiments.",,,,,,

"Palladium has always been a metal of interest for its hydrogen absorption qualities [lJ and, more recently, for its use in cold fusion experiments [2J. An atomic model of the metallic crystal would give a better overall understanding of the palladium-hydrogen system. Unfortunately, a computer simulation of the wave mechanical properties of palladium based on solving the three-dimensional Schrodinger equation is a major undertaking [3, 4J that is probably unnecessary for calculating many useful character istics of palladium. A simpler approach, based on a Thomas-Fermi model [5J for palladium, is proposed by the authors. This semiclassical model averages the effects of all the electrons within an atom to approximate the electric field distribution everywhere. Overlapping these distr ibutions approximates the electric fields within the palladium crystal. This model predicts a crystal that is a bit too stiff, but overall it gives reasonable results; it is also simple to use. It is expected that this model will broaden the understanding of the interaction of hydrogen with palladium.",,,,,,

"INTRODUCTION Our interest in the ""cold fusion"" process [1,2] was piqued by the apparent lack of systematic investigation into the composition of the gaseous products produced during the electrolysis of D2O. A critical issue in determining whether or not the cold fusion process exists is the quality of the evidence concerning the composition of the gaseous products. The low intensity of neutrons has prompted proposals of other fusion processes such as d + d → 4He + γ [3] and p + d → 3He [4,5]. Accord­ingly, we report the results of experiments designed to detect helium in the effluent gases from electrolysis reactions at palladium cathodes while rigorously excluding possible helium contamination from other sources. The calorimetric electrolysis experiments reported here were performed at China Lake, and the analyses designed to establish the composition of the effluent gases were performed in Austin.",,,,,,

"ABSTRACT: Part I presented evidence in support of Bush's TRM Model and, in particular, his hypothesis of ""alkali-hydrogen fusion"" in a lattice as a prototype for cold fusion with both light and heavy water. In Part II preliminary evidence is presented for x-ray emission accompanying both the heavy and light water excess heat effects in the form of both characteristic x-rays and bremmstrahlung. These studies had the unsatisfactory feature of low signal-to-noise, but the satisfactory features of reasonable statistics and excellent correlation. An interesting feature was that x-ray emission decreased somewhat after a cell was switched off, but then spiked upward to decay exponentially to the background level over a period of days. This emission was apparently associated with the desorption of hydrogen from the cathode. With the cell turned off it was also possible to study xray emission accompanying the thermal desorption of hydrogen by changing the cell temperature and studying x-ray emission as a function of cathode surface temperature. When this effect of x-rays accompanying desorption was factored in, Bush's TRM Model appears to account for the correlation between x-ray emission and excess power.",,,,,,

"The author's ECFM (""Electron Catalyzed Fusion Model"") first presented at the ICCF-4 is re-examined with special reference to the production of tritium and neutrons. The model is of some interest in that it is the first model to fit excess power-vs-Ioading fraction data of McKubre et al. (SRI Intemational/EPRI) and, independently, that of Kunimatsu et al. (IMRA). Of special note is that the peak of the theoretical curve of tritium production versus loading fraction, which is related to that for neutrons by a branching ratio scaling factor, is found to be at a fractional DlPd loading of approximately 0.825, whlch is in go.od agreement with the empirical value of 0.83 announced at the ICCF-5 by Iwamura et al.(Mitsuoishi) for both tritlUm and neutrons. It is of interest then that this theoretical ECFM tritium production curve arises essentially from purely statistical mechanical considerations involving the deuteron occupation of the three-dimensional interstitial lattice, rather than arising from the details of a specific nuclear mechanism. The model shows why tritium is ordinarily not observed when excess heat is being observed. For the neutron-to-triton branching ratio a theoretical lower limit (r/R)^12 results (r is the protonic charge radius and R is the deuteronic charge radius.) yielding a value of 2 x 10^-9 in agreement with the empirical value of 2 x 10^-9 for the neutron-to-triton branching ratio.",,,,,,

"Abstract: The results from a growing number of laboratories suggest that the Pons and Fleischmann effect (the production of ""excess heat"" during the electrolysis of D2O at palladium electrodes) is real. More over data from these laboratories indicate that excess heat events are accompanied by 4He production. Excess heat generation appears to depend on a number of factors: the quality — nature — of the cathode, chemical species present in the D2O / LiOD electrolyte, the conditions surrounding the electrolysis process — current density, potential, time, and the previous history of the cathode. Methods for obtaining useful cathodes will be described.",,,,,,

"Palladium samples taken from the center section of a 2-mm diameter cylindrical heat-producing cathode and similar material from the original stock palladium rod adjacent to that used for the cathode have been analyzed by neutron activation analysis for trace element impurity differences. The focus was on all elements for which NAA is appropriate and sensitive. Although it is known that electrolysis deposits impurity metals on cathodic surfaces from the electrolyte (lithium deuteroxide in this case), this occurs only at the external surface of the rod. The samples were cut diametrally to minimize the surface relative to the bulk or interior portion of the cathode. Large increases in iron and zinc of a factor of 56 and 12 respectively were observed in the active cathode relative to the virgin material. Smaller but significant increases were observed for chromium, cobalt, and cesium. In addition, the Pd-110/Pd-108 ratios were determined. Preliminarily, it appears that Pd-108 was depleted in the active cathode relative to Pd-110 as compared with that ratio in the virgin material. Possible sources of these changes in addition to the conventional explanations are discussed.",,,,,,

"Space faring, including space exploration, commercialization, and colonization, requires serious levels of power and energy. It is required for in-space and on-body propulsion, habitats and transportation, In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU), manufacturing, life support, robotics, satellites, sensors, and construction. The current power and energy sources being applied and under development include solar energy, chemical fuels, radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) nuclear batteries, and fission nuclear reactors. There are problems with each of these including reductions in solar intensity farther from the Sun and due to dust, ISRU resource processing requirements, storage, transfer of chemical fuels and the weight, energy density, and safety of the current nuclear approaches [ref. 1]. Alternative energy sources could reduce cost and weight and improve safety, efficiency, and functionality. . . .",,,,,,

"Investigations to analyze the cathodic loading of hydrogen and deuterium in palladium thin-films, using a Fleischmann-Pons (Fleischmann/1989, Fleischmann/1990) type open cell system, have demonstrated the production of significant thermal power using an electrolyte of concentrated lithium hydroxide in heavy water. Power levels exceeding 200 watts over a 20 hour period have been observed, although this large thermal response was obtained in only 4 out of 16 experiment runs, each using a new Pd cathode and electrolyte solution. In most cases, thermal power began after loading the Pd films followed by temperature cycling of the cell from room temperature to near 60 °C. However one run showed a large thermal output without electrolytic loading of the cathode, indicating the possibility of a catalyzed chemical reaction between the electrolyte, the Pd cathode and Pt anode, and the air cover over the cell. Indeed all power producing runs were accompanied by a precipitated formation oflithium carbonate, indicating a strong coupling of the reaction with CO2 in the air.",,,,,,

"An attempt is made to build an LENR theory that does not contradict any basic principle of physics and gives a relatively simple explanation to the plethora of experimental results. A single unconventional assumption is made, namely that nuclei are kept together by a magnetic attraction mechanism, as proposed in the 1980s of the past century by Valerio Dallacasa and Norman Cook. This assumption contradicts a non-proven detail of the standard model, which instead attributes the nuclear force to a residual effect of the strong interaction. The theory is based also on a property of the electron which has been known for long, but has rarely been used: the Zitterbewegung (ZB). This property should allow the magnetic attraction mechanism that binds nucleons together, to manifest also between the electron and any isotope of hydrogen, leading to the formation of three neutral pseudo-particles (the component particles remain separate entities), collectively named here Hydronions (or Hyd). These pseudo-particles can then couple with other nuclei and lead to a fusion reaction ""inside"" the electron. The Coulomb barrier is not overcome kinetically, but through what could be interpreted as a range extension of the nuclear force itself, realized by the electron when some specific conditions are satisfied. The most important of these necessary conditions is that the electron has to ""orbit"" the hydrogen nucleus at a frequency of 2.055 x 1016Hz. This frequency corresponds to photons with an energy of about 85 eV or equivalently a wavelength of 14.6 nm in the Extreme Ultra Violet (EUV). So the large quanta of nuclear energy fractionate into EUV photons during the formation of the Hydronions and during the coupling of Hydronions to other nuclei. The formation of Hydronions requires the so called Nuclear Active Environment (NAE), which is what makes LENR so rare and difficult to reproduce. The numbers suggest that the NAE forms when an unshielded atomic core electron orbital that has an ""orbital frequency"" near to the coupling frequency is stricken by a naked Hydrogen Nucleus (HNu). This theory therefore implies that the NAE is not inside the metal matrix, but in its immediate neighbourhood. The best candidate atoms for a NAE are listed, based on the energy of their ionization energies. The coincidence with the most common LENR materials appears noteworthy. The Electron Mediated Nuclear Reactions (EMNR) theory can explain also very rapid runaway conditions, radio emissions, biological NAE, and the so called ""strange radiation"".",,,,,,

The electrolyte, as its chemistry changes during the electrolysis, is shown to damage the acrylic cell containing the experiment and to damage an aluminum foil separated from the electrolyte by a Mylar film. This damage together with the absence of pits when a small air gap is added to the Mylar protection suggests chemical reactions may be the source of the observed CR-39 pits.",,,,,,

"In this study, a new hydrogen permeation model through Pd-based membranes is developed and used to analyze the role of the concentration polarization. According to this new model, the entire hydrogen permeation process is divided into several elementary steps: multicomponent mass transport in the feed and permeate side, adsorption and desorption on/from the membrane surface, absorption and de-absorption into/from the metal lattice, diffusion through the Pd-based bulk and multicomponent mass transport through an asymmetric multilayered porous support. Each of these steps is modeled by means of some equations whose solution provides as result the value of transmembrane flux and the hydrogen partial pressure profile through the membrane. The influence of each step is evaluated as a function of several operating conditions (membrane thickness, temperature, fluid-dynamic conditions, hydrogen partial pressure on feed and permeate side). The effect of the mass transfer in the feed and permeate side is evaluated in terms of concentration polarization effect by defining an opportune coefficient and analyzing its behaviour in different conditions. As results, the investigation shows that the influence of the polarization can be appreciable even for not so thin membranes and provides some ""polarization maps"", which are diagrams where the polarization level (in terms of CPC) can be directly visualized and simply estimated once knowing the external operating conditions. Hence, these maps can be very useful in order to predict better the membrane performances and, consequently, reduce the uncertainness during the design step of the membrane modules.",,,,,,

The superficial elemental micro-analysis on these spots showed some interesting and macroscopic departures of the concentration of chemical elements from that of the undamaged surface, which may suggest that, along with the emission of neutrons, some transmutations occurred as well.",,,,,,

"Recent experiments conducted on natural rocks subjected to different mechanical loading conditions have shown energy emissions in the form of neutrons and anomalous chemical changes. In the present study, a numerical model is used to simulate the anomalous nuclear products according to the fission interpretation. Specifically, the reactions were simulated by means of a nuclear lattice model assuming that nucleons are ordered in an antiferromagnetic face-centered-cubic (fcc) array. The simulations indicate that small and middle-sized nuclei can be fractured along weakly bound planes of the lattice structure. It is argued that the simulations provide theoretical support for the experimentally-observed reactions and, moreover, that the probabilities calculated for various low-energy fissions can be used to explain the stepwise changes in the element abundances of the Earth’s crust, evolved from basaltic to sialic composition over geological time.",,,,,,

"Several evidences of anomalous nuclear reactions occurring in condensed matter have been observed in the phenomena of electrolysis, fracture (solids), and cavitation (liquids). Despite the great amount of experimental results coming from the so-called Cold Nuclear Fusion and Low Energy Nuclear Reactions research activities, the comprehension of these phenomena still remains unanswered. On the other hand, as reported by most of the articles devoted to Cold Nuclear Fusion, one of the principal features is the appearance of micro-cracks on the electrode surfaces after the experiments. In the present paper, a mechanical explanation is proposed considering a new kind of nuclear reactions, the piezonuclear fissions, which are a consequence of hydrogen embrittlement of the electrodes during electrolysis. The experimental activity was conducted using a Ni–Fe anode and a Co–Cr cathode immersed in a potassium carbonate solution. Emissions of neutrons and alpha particles were measured during the experiments and the electrode compositions were analyzed both before and after the electrolysis, recognizing the effects of piezonuclear fissions occurring in the host lattices. The symmetrical fission of Ni appears to be the main and most evident feature. Such reaction would produce two Si atoms or two Mg atoms with additional fragments as alpha particles.",,,,,,

"Long empirical study has defined one specific set of experimental conditions under which D2 reproducibly undergoes nuclear fusion under mild laboratory conditions. Gaseous D2 is contacted with a supported metallic catalyst at superatmospheric pressure, and about 130-300° C. The catalyst is a platinum-group metal, at about 1/2% to 1% by weight, on activated carbon. Pd, Pt, Ir and Rh all work, and Ru has not been carefully studied yet. (Pd is preferred). This type of PGM on activated carbon is one of the standard hetero­geneous catalysts employed in the chemical industry, but the useful range of PGM content is much narrower than is known to be generally useful. . . .",,,,,,

The characterized metallurgical properties include the main grain size, the grain boundary, the material Vickers hardness, and the crystal grain orientation. Electrochemical properties that are recorded include the D/Pd loading ratio and the D/Pd low current loading ratio. A suitable correlation parameter has been defined and correlations have been found between excess heat production and individual properties; i.e. the mean grain size, grain boundary, material hardness, crystal grain orientation, deuterium loading and low-current deuterium loading level.",,,,,,

"The reproducibility of anomalous excess heat production during electro-chemical deuterium permeation of Pd cathodes has been recently observed1 to be strongly correlated with the palladium surface properties (easy loading at low current, crystal grain distribution, crystallographic orientation, and surface morphology). The understanding of the physical mechanism that is responsible for such observed correlation is very challenging and it is complicated further by the fact that the different features are not, in principle, independent each from the other. In this work, the experimental results concerning the correlation of the excess heat production with the cathode surface properties are reviewed and some possible connections of the observed effects with the deuterium kinetics inside the palladium and the electromagnetic interactions at the metal/electrolyte interface are discussed.",,,,,,

In order to estimate the actual performance and possible measurement errors during electrolysis in the calorimeter used, including heat convection, bubbling and possible H2+O2 recombination, smooth Pt sheets were used as cathodes in special reference runs.

"ABSTRACT Nuclear transmutation results in palladium films loaded with deuterium gas and processed by an excimer laser are reported. Vacuum evaporation was utilised to obtain palladium films on Si wafers. The films were inserted in chambers with deuterium gas at a variable pressure up to 5 bar. During the UV laser processing the maximum irradiating energy density was lower than 50 mJ/cm in order to avoid the ablation of the palladium films. The samples were analysed by a scanning electron microscope and an electron probe microanalyzer. After the experiments, we found that the Pd films was modified. They presented many cracks and bubbles with very sharp edges. In the bubbles the transmutation of elements was observed.",,,,,,

The reaction ratios D(d,p)T/D(d,n)3He and 6Li(d,p)7Li/6Li(d,α)4He in particular were examined for possible evidence of an Oppenheimer-Phillips type enhancement. No significant enhancement was found in either ratio or in the absolute yields of the reactions. The radiative capture reactions D(d,γ)4He and 6Li(d,γ)8Be were likewise measured. The branching ratios of these radiative capture reactions to the nucleonic branches of the reactions appear roughly independent of energy.

A high peak current (15 A), short width pulse (duration 1 μs) electrolysis technique has been used to test all cathode plates and it is visible that this technique permits to reach very high D/Pd loading values (around 1/1 or even more for palladium).

"Electrolyses of long and thin Pd (and PdY alloy) wires, in dilute solutions of LiOD-D20 and LiOHH20 at large operating voltages, were made. An innovative kind of geometrical set-up to improve the efficiency of electromigration effect in proton conductors was developed: the usual ""single-ended"" geometry at the most cathodic point of the wire changed to the ""central wire"" geometry. The detected excess heat seems to be related to: (HID) isotopic effect, lattice characteristics, geometrical set-up, dynamic variation of concentration inside Pd wire, anode-cathode and inter-cathodic voltages.",,,,,,

We performed an ultra-short width high voltage pulse electrolysis using a Pd thin wire cathode; a diluted electrolytic solution of D2P+LiOD was used in a peculiar wire-turned electrodes geometry.,,,,,,

The deuterated Pd loading was evaluated by the D/Pd normalized electric resistance curve (R/Ro). After a long time of electrolysis a very high D/Pd loading (1:1 or more) was reached.,,,,,,

Very low R/Ro (<0.1) Pd wire was measured after switching of electrolysis and this effect lasted for several minutes. The deuterium deloading occurred in several typologies (fast and slow terms) showed as a resistance transition on the Pd wire.,,,,,,

"A new procedure has been developed at INFN Frascati Laboratory in order to achieve a very high Hydrogen or Deuterium electrolytic loading into a long and thin Palladium wire. This technique consists in the addition of a very small amount of alkaline-earth elements into a very diluted acidic solution. Because of enhancing pH values around the cathode, during the electrolysis, carbonates are able to precipitate onto the cathode’s surface forming a thin layer which strongly increases the Pd loading; a computer simulation has been developed to find out the proper working conditions for the carbonates precipitation. Loading results of Hydrogen were excellent (H/Pd1). The evidence of a new phase in the Pd-H system was inferred from the basis of the variation of the thermal resistivity coefficient of the Pd wire as a function of the H/Pd ratio. . . .",,,,,,

"Abstract The insoluble powder recovered at the bottom of our electrolytic cell, after several electrolytic deuterium loading/deloading cycles, was analysed by an ICP-MS analyser. The electrolyte was constituted of a deuterated hydro-alcoholic solution; Sr and Hg salts were added to such a solution at micromolar concentration; the cathode was a long and thin Pd wire. The ICP-MS analyses of the insoluble powder were motivated from the recent results of Y. Iwamura and collaborators at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries-Research Center (Yokohama, Japan) showing reproducible ""transmutation"" of Sr into Mo (isotopic composition different from natural one) and Cs into Pr, when a special multilayer Pd sheet was subjected to a prolonged Deuterium gas flowing. Some of our results look partially in agreement with Y. Iwamura report. Other unexpected elements were also detected with an isotopic distribution close to the natural one. The production of stable isotopes by Selective Channel Photofission, according to the model of A.Takahashi (Osaka University, Japan), can help for nderstanding. Further works, hopefully also from other Laboratories, are needed to clarify these kinds of results.",,,,,,

The resulting large and dynamic loading of the Pd wires was studied. The recent use of thorium instead of strontium resulted in thermal anomalies and detection of new elements in larger amounts. The results with Sr are qualitatively in agreement with what was found by Y. Iwamura (Mitsubishi Heavy Industries) using multilayers of Pd-CaO-Pd-Sr in flowing deuterium gas.

A long (65 cm) and thin (50 μm) Pd wire is coated with thin layers of Pd nano-particles, stabilized against self-sintering by the addition of selected chemical elements: the coating is adhered to the wire surface by heating it in air up to about 800°C. The wire is then heated with up to 1 A of direct current in a pressurized D2 gas atmosphere. The D+ deuterons in the Pd lattice are forced to move toward the cathodic end of the wire because of the voltage drop along the wire (the Cöhn effect). Large excess power density (about 400 W/g of Pd), at high temperatures (up to 400-500°C), is then measured using isoperibolic calorimetry. The reference experiment is made, in situ and without opening the cell, using a Pt wire of same dimensions as the Pd wire, to which was applied the same electrical power. . . .",,,,,,

Mainly, the Pd wire temperature was increased up to 750°C and was improved the temperature detection of anomalous excess heat, if any, using a SS shielded type-K thermocouple: it was put inside a small Cu tube, used as thermal equalizer, where, at the outer surface, both the ""active"" Pd wire and the ""reference"" Pt were twisted. The overall results were in agreement with that obtained in 2008 experiments and they confirm the positive effect of high temperatures in increasing the amount of anomalous energy gain. In both the experiments the fast and simple isoperibolic calorimetry was used. Main gas adopted were: He and He (60%)-Ar(40%) mixture, both for calibration purposes; D2 and D2(60%)-Ar(40%) as potentially active gas.",,,,,,

We developed a reactor with a core of sub-micrometric layered Cnst wires that produced measurable excess power (almost reproducible). Subsequently, we used fiberglass sheaths as electrical insulation and found out that this material actually improves reactor performance. In the most recent configuration, we studied the effects of adding Fe nanolayers to the Cnst wires and of including several small knots along their extension, actions that resulted in a larger excess power that grew with increasing wire temperature. We detected a new electric effect: the generation of spontaneous voltage between the ends of a floating wire in the reactor.

"At INFN-LNF, starting in 2011, we have investigated the behavior of the Constantan (Cst) alloy (Cu55Ni44Mn1; ISOTAN44) with hydrogen and/or deuterium (H2/D2) absorption and the generation of anomalous excess heat (AHE) at high temperatures (i.e. >200?C). To further improve the intrinsic, excellent catalytic proprieties of Cst in H2 ?2H dissociation, we subjected the surface to repeated cycling of ""flash"" oxidation (pulsed power up to 20 kVA/g), obtaining sub-micrometric particles of mixed composition (Cst–NiOx–CuOy–CuxNiyOz) and reducing deleterious self-sintering problems with nano-materials at high temperatures. Despite the fact that results with thin, long wires (F = 200 µm, l = 100 cm) were generally positive and excess power (10–20%) was frequently recorded (5–10 W at 50 W input), reproducibility remained unsatisfactory. Later, we realized that iron impurities (up to 1% in the old, pre-1970 batch of Cst) enhanced AHE generation, especially atT > 500?C. Since 2014, we added Fe(NO3)3 solutions both to the Cst sub-micrometric surfaces (during flash oxidation process),and to borosilicate glass sheaths (SIGI-Fabier; micrometric fibers, previously wetted-dried with Sr(NO3)2 solution) where wires were inserted (as electrical insulation). Recently, we adopted the methodology of making several knots along wires (holes 150–200 µm), later coated multiple times with an iron solution. . . .",,,,,,

"Anomalous Heat Effects (AHE) have been observed in wires of Cu55Ni44Mn1 (Constantan) exposed to H2 and D2 in multiple experiments during the last eight years. Improvements in the magnitude and reproducibility of AHE, and improvements in wire preparation and reactor design were reported by the authors in the present and previous papers. The oxidation of the wires by pulses of electrical current in air creates a rough surface featuring a sub-micrometric texture that proves particularly effective at inducing thermal anomalies when temperature exceeds 400?C. This effect appears also to be increased substantially by deposing segments of the wire with a series of elements (such as Fe, Sr, Mn, K, via thermal decomposition of their nitrates applied from a water solution). Furthermore, an increase of AHE was observed after placing the treated wires inside a sheath made of borosilicate glass (B–Si–Ca; BSC), and even more after impregnating the sheath with the same elements used to coat the wires. . . .",,,,,,

"This paper presents a summary and some deeper details about the experiments presented at the 22nd International Conference on Condensed Matter Nuclear Science (ICCF22). It reports on the experimental study of LENR phenomena in Constantan (Cu55Ni44Mn1) from its inception in 2011 to the most recent experiments. Using an empirical approach we identified the effect of surface modification of the Constantan wires with coatings comprised of elements that enhance the absorption behavior, and oxides with low work function for electron emission. We also explored certain geometrical arrangements of the wires such as knots and coils in order to induce local thermal gradients and predictable hot-spots. Moreover, the DC polarization of the wires by a counter-electrode proved to be a versatile approach to induce non-equilibrium conditions that are essential for Anomalous Heat Effects (AHE), especially when a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) is produced. From the review of experiments summarized in this article, we obtain indications that the main parameter controlling the AHE is the flux of reactive species through the surface of the loaded material. As a consequence, all other external conditions of the reactor core (voltage–current, temperature, pressure, electric field stimulations, DC and/or AC external fields), can be seen as co-factors that enable a flux of active species through surfaces and in the bulk of the materials. Although most of the tests are in agreement with a possible flux model, some results still lack an interpretation, probably due to limits of the experimental setup.",,,,,,

In the framework of LENR-AHE (Low Energy Nuclear Reaction - Anomalous Heat Effects) studies, since 2021, we have been focused on innovative, low-cost materials instead of the usual, precious metal palladium.

While the catalytic feature appears at a rather low temperature (150 ?C), Constantan is also able to store atomic hydrogen within its lattice and/or at surfaces, up to temperature of 700-800 ?C, and in a wide range of pressures. Thanks to our long experience (since 1994) with wires, we designed various experiments that take advantage of such specific shapes, namely in terms of electromigration of absorbed and adsorbed H, under a suitable longitudinal electric field (0.4-2.5 V/cm), DC and/or pulsed. In 1995 we got noticeable results using Pd wires in electrolytic environments (D2O) at mild temperatures (40-60 ?C).

We briefly discuss this calorimetric procedure which requires calibration runs at the beginning of the experiments, and before introducing active gases (H2, D2). To prevent and check the absence of the well-known artifacts that may affect this technique, we also perform measurements in gases featuring different thermal conductivity (such as Argon and Helium) or at low pressure (where the thermal conductivity of the gas phase reaches its minimum). After the calibrations, and accuracy testing with Helium, Argon, or vacuum, we discuss the outcome of experiments where the constantan wires are heated with alternating currents (AC) of different waveform or shape.

"Abstract The energy balance between heat excess and 4He in the gas phase has been found reasonably satisfied even if the low levels of 4He found do not give the necessary confidence to state definitely that we are dealing with the fusion of deuterons to give 4He. In the melted cathode, whose data are reported here, 4He was not found at the achieved sensitivity. X-ray film, positioned at 50 mm from the cell, roughly gave the image of the cathode through spots. The energy of the radiation and the total energy associated to it have been, respectively, evaluated as (89±1) keV and (12.0 ± 0.4) kJ. This value is ≈ 0.5% of the energy measured by calorimetry in the same interval of time.",,,,,,

"Deuteron-deuteron fusions were claimed by a Brookhaven group to re sult from the impact on deuterated surfaces of clusters of 25 - 1350 D2O molecules with energy up to 300 ke V. The collective motion in the impact region is tentatively assumed to be responsible for these fusion events. The number of involved atoms is of the order of 10^4 , with a mean energy of some electronvolts. The model is able to reproduce qualitatively the Brookhaven data according to an Arrhenius plot, with an activation energy E* ~ 2E0 , where E0 is the hydrogen ionization energy. At this energy an activated precursor is postulated to be synthesized; it can tentatively be identified as the binuclear atom (D^+ - D^+)2e^-.",,,,,,

"Summary. -- Anomalous heat production in a nickel rod loaded with hydrogen has been reported by Focardi et al. (Nuovo Cimento A, 107 (1994) 163). We have investigated this phenomenon by repeating the experiment. We found the results previously published to be consistent with our observations; namely we measured higher temperatures for the same input power when hydrogen is absorbed during a heating cycle. Nevertheless this temperature rise does not appear to correspond to an increase in heat production. We have added a temperature sensor to the container of the experiment. The temperature of the container follows the same temperature with input power curve irrespective of whether there is an anomalous absorption of hydrogen or not; therefore we have no evidence that this temperature increase corresponds to another source of heat. In conclusion, we have observed all the effects discovered by Focardi et al., but our results imply that there is no production of power associated with the absorption of hydrogen by nickel",,,,,,

The three dimensional heat conduction computer code HEATING5 was used to simulate the isoperibolic calorimeter being used for cold fusion experiments at Stanford University. The simulation results confirm the measured temperature distribution in the calorimeter. Computer analysis also demonstrates that temperature measurements for this particular calorimeter are independent of the heat source position in the calorimeter. A numerical procedure was developed to derive the transient behavior of the heat generation in the cold fusion cell from the transient temperature measurements. This procedure was exercised using a measured temperature pulse. The transient behavior of the power pulse was in the form of square-wave and its magnitude was slightly higher than the on-line calculation based on a steady-state approach.,,,,,,

"Thin palladium films deposited on quartz have been loaded with hydrogen (deuterium) by electrochemical reduction of 0.1 M LiOH (LiOD) in H2O (D2O). Coulometric measurements during both the hydrogen deposition and subsequent removal steps have shown that H:Pd ratios of 0.7 are reached under these conditions, in accord with accepted values for bulk samples. The frequency decrease observed at AT-cut crystals during hydrogen (deuterium) loading is larger than that expected for the mass of hydrogen deposited into the film. Considering that palladium undergoes a substantial increase in volume upon hydrogen uptake, the role of the resulting film stress in influencing the observed frequency must be addressed. It has been found that such film stresses at an AT-cut crystal produce frequency decreases and that these effects can be accounted for using techniques which are well established in the frequency control field. Measurements at BT-cut crystals, the stress/frequency response of which is opposite to that of AT-cut crystals, have confirmed that stress plays a major role in the present work and have allowed the determination of a quantitative value for this stress. Investigations of mixtures of H2O and D20 have also been carried out and shed some light on the effect of small amounts of H2O in determining the H/D content in the palladium.",,,,,,

"This paper consists of two parts. One part describes a new analytical method for the conventional electrolytic cold fusion experiment. The other part contains a discussion and explanation on the cold fusion effect. Heat bursts are observed in this experiment for both Ni(-)/Pt(+)/H2O/K2CO3 and Pd( -)lPt( + )fD20fLiOD cells. Careful detection of neutron and tritium has not been available, although very preliminary neutron detection of heavy water cell shows roughly two times of the background level during electrolysis. The vast experimental data worldwide show a low neutrontritium ratio of 10^-8 to 10^-4 , far below the equal branching ratio, having been explained in this paper by a secondary nuclear process by the author. According to this secondary nuclear process, the generated neutrons and protons inside the solid has the chance to recombine into deuterium atoms for heavy water systems. In this sense the Huizenga's second and third miracles, the branching ratio miracle and the no nuclear products miracle, are therefore equivalent. This paper also proposes a ""pycnon field"" to try to treat the correlation of the high dlPd ratio and pycno-reactions. Although the detail has not been worked out yet.",,,,,,

The X-ray energy spectrum was measured and X rays were confirmed existing by the absorption method, the characteristic X-ray approach and the NaI scintillation counters. The average X-ray energy (26.9 +/- 2.2 keV) measured by the absorption method is in agreement within the error range with X-ray one (26.0 +/- 2.4 keV) detected by NaI scintillation counters. The X-ray intensity measured roughly by use of the 7U thermoluminescent foils is about 10^9 - 10^10 s^-1.",,,,,,

"We propose a mechanism that may allow for understanding of the cluster-impact fusion experiment of Beuhler, Friedlander, and Friedman. When the cluster of D2O molecules collides with the metallic surface, the cluster dissociates into a collection of D and 0 atoms. In the process, a significant portion of the translational kinetic energy of the cluster is converted to thermal energy, so that the system thermalizes to become a ""warm atomic plasma"". The neutral D atoms in the warm atomic plasma then fuse with the D atoms in the lattice via direct scattering, without going through the doorway step of forming D2 molecules. As a rough estimate for the fusion reaction rate, the velocity distribution of the thermalized D atoms is taken to be Maxwell-Boltzmann, leading to results in qualitative agreement with the experimental observations for a cluster of about 100 - 300 molecules.",,,,,,

The following facts point to this: intensive migration, diffusion and release of hydrogen isotopes from metals at low temperature; superlinear dependence of H, D release from metals on the electron current density and H, D concentration; H and D release from the whole volume of samples during the irradiation process by focused electron beam; H and D release in both molecular and atomic forms.",,,,,,

A simple model for describing the screening effect of the Coulomb nuclear barrier by the high electron concentration in condensed matter is presented. The nuclear reaction rate of the hydrogen isotope nuclei, trapped in a metallic lattice is assessed, both for the unscreened and for the screened Coulomb barrier, averaged by the Maxwell distribution. The model predicts that, in certain circumstances, for porous or grainy samples, which are subject to a negative electric potential and are heavily loaded with deuterium, very low nuclear radiation level might be detected. The results are discussed in connection with some of the very successful experiments like Miley’s metal-coated spheres.",,,,,,

Thin foils of different pure metals were and thin spattered layers of different pure metals on different substrates were used as cathodes. Excess power results, the power density and details on the combinations of cathode and electrolyte are also presented. The results reveal that a higher excess power density was obtained using thin film metal cathodes than thin foils. Another interesting result is that the excess power density appears to be correlated with the current density along the cathode.

"A Pd electrode has been examined which produced a concentration of tritium in a 0.1 M LiOD solution around 10^3 times above background. Tritium production at a given potential ceased after a few days, but could be restarted by a small increase of the deuterium overpotential. Correspondingly, He4 was found in 9-10 pieces of the Pd electrode at 2-100 times background. Addition of fresh amounts of D2O quenched the T production which began again spontaneously after 1-2 days. If the T had come from contamination, 3He would have been found in the electrode: it was absent. Loss of charge by the nucleus lakes place when the fugacity of D in voids exceeds 10^17 atm (Lifshitz and Pitaevskii, 1963). Sporadicity of function arises from the state of the surface, which is difficult to reproduce. The surface state controls the mechanism of D- evolution: only some mechanisms give a fugacity high enough to cause fusion. Only one electrode out of four examined produced T and 4He. The surface of this electrode contained a Cu-mosaic structure, not seen on the inactive electrodes.",,,,,,

A low-background high-resolution Ge detector surrounded by neutron scatterers was applied to investigate fast neutrons from the electrochemically loaded Pd-D system. The neutron flux was obtained by measuring the yields of the γ-rays following inelastic scattering of the fast neutrons from nuclei in the scatterers. The detector was shown to be very sensitive in the search for rare neutron events such as d-d fusion at room temperature. The observed spectrum shows no statistically significant excess of the γ-rays above the background. The upper limit on the fusion rate was obtained as λf<1.6·10^-24(ddn)fusions/(dd)pair/s.,,,,,,

Perhaps our considerations have their own risks because the majority of mainstream physicists consider nuclear fusion rather as a phenomenon associated with tunneling through a Coulomb barrier, which is a pure quantum effect. We will discuss that there are some aspects of classical electromagnetic theories which may have impact on our understanding on LENR/CMNS phenomena, including: (a) nonlinear electrostatic potential as proposed by Eugen Andreev, (b) vortex sound theory of Tsutomu Kambe, (c) nonlinear ponderomotive force, and (d) submicroscopic consideration.",,,,,,

"In a recent paper published in JCMNS in 2017, Francesco Celani, Di Tommaso and Vassalo argued that Maxwell equations rewritten in Clifford algebra are sufficient to describe the electron and also ultra-dense deuterium reaction process proposed by Homlid et al. Apparently, Celani et al. believed that their Maxwell–Clifford equations are an excellent candidate to surpass both Classical Electromagnetic and Zitterbewegung QM. Meanwhile, in a series of papers, Bo Lehnert proposed a novel and revised version of Quantum Electrodynamics (RQED) based on Proca equations. Therefore, in this paper, we gave an outline of Lehnert’s RQED, as an alternative framework to Celani et al Zitterbewegung-Classical EM. Moreover, in a rather old paper, Mario Liu described hydrodynamic Maxwell equations. While he also discussed potential implications of these new approaches to superconductors, such a discussion of electrodynamics of superconductors is made only after Tajmar’s paper. . . .",,,,,,

This paper presents a theory of condensed matter fusion in crystals based on the periodic potential provided by an ordered lattice and the approximate Bose statistics obeyed by bosons on length scales associated with electrostatic interactions. The resulting nuclear interaction proceeds in a manner that approximately preserves either the initial periodicity of the lattice or the periodicity of a commensurate lattice. Reaction reversibility over timescales associated with electrostatic interaction results in condensed matter fusion being dominated by interactions in which both the products and reactants obey Bose-Einstein statistics. As a result tritium release and 3He+ production should not appear as primary fusion products.,,,,,,

We present a theory of solid state fusion based on the formation of a D+ bosonic Bloch condensate within a metal deuteride. The first step towards fusion is a coalescence reaction which converts a 4-fold occupation state of zero point motion size into a state of nuclear dimensions . Reaction rates for the coalescence reaction are calculated using the Fermi Golden Rule.,,,,,,

"Cooperative ionic fluctuations, which become energetically favorable during the overcharging of a sufficiently ordered, stoichiometric Pd-D lattice, provide a means for an entirely new form of nuclear interaction, ""cold"" or ""solid state"" fusion. As a consequence, I) nucleons separated by macroscopic distances in a classical sense may interact in a nuclear fashion quantum mechanically. and 2) nuclear fusion may occur in which unfamiliar products are released. The evolution of such an ionic nuctuation. which we have named a Bose Bloch Condensate (BBC). becomes favorable as the concentrations of D and Pd become comparable because of I arge energy costs from lattice strain at individual lattice sites that result from coulombic repulsion associated with the occupation of a site by more than one D. . . .",,,,,,

The new world-view that results from this different perspective is the basis of our ""Lattice Induced Nuclear Chemistry"" (LINC) theory of cold fusion. We conclude the paper by summarizing some of the most important results of LINC. These include our predictions (prior to the experimental work by Bush et al.) that 1) it is to be expected that the primary cold fusion byproducts in the electrolytic experiments involved Pd and D probably are heat and low-energy 4He, 2) the 4He should remain largely on trapped within the bulk electrode and be found primarily in the surface region and out gases, and 3) there is a need to satisfy a critical loading condition (of x~1 in PdDx) in the electrolytic experiments.",,,,,,

A theory of solid-state fusion based on the interaction between D+ and 4He++ ion band states within a host lattice is presented. Formation of ion band-state deuterium is thermo-dynamically favored when lattice strain energy is greater than the incremental chemical potential of the band state. The key fusion step is a coalescence fluctuation that converts a twofold occupation state of electrostatic zero-point-motion size into a state of nuclear dimensions. Rates are calculated using the Fermi Golden Rule. Fusion energy is shared between band-state members and subsequently transferred to the lattice.,,,,,,

"We have previously explained how the occupation of ion band states by hydrogen (H) and deuterium (D) in palladium deuteride PdD and possibly Ni can result in radiationless fusion. The explanation includes a number of assumptions about the governing conditions associated with the process. As a consequence of these assumptions we predicted1-3 important excess heat phenomena (loading requirements, by-products, etc.) of Cold Fusion (CF) that were subsequently observed4,5. Although the governing ideas are based on mainstream solid state physics ideas, the underlying theory ""seems"" to have ""evaded"" a number of potential problems that have bothered many people concerning CF. As we have explained recently6,7, as a result of these solid state physics effects, discontinuous changes in momentum and singularities in the effective kinetic energies associated with H or D that may occur through the occupation of ion band states provide a means for eliminating the phenomena that seemingly are omitted by the theory. In this paper we clarify the origin of these effects and their relationship to questions that have been raised associated with our treatment of the Coulomb barrier.",,,,,,

"Using the Ion Band State (IBS) theory, we predicted a number of important effects that were subsequently observed3 in Cold Fusion anomalous heat experiments. Despite this fact, the theory has inspired controversy4and confusions. By addressing the skeptics, we have learned that both the success of the theory and the controversy it seems to provoke have a common origin: our application of conventional, mainstream, solid state, many-body physics ideas that are known to describe the physics of hydrogen inside7 and on the surface7 of transition metals, to the PdD Cold Fusion problem. Our application of these mainstream ideas is inconsistent with the predominant paradigm that is commonly applied to Cold Fusion because it uses important ideas that relate periodic order to coherence that are known to apply at low temperature (LT) in solids and to hydrogen-in-metal systems that are not consistent with the conventional high temperature (HT) models that have formed the basis of conventional thinking. Implicit in this alternative (LT) picture is the important result that symmetry provides a means of ""hiding"" the potential location of a particular nuclear reaction. As a consequence: 1. it becomes impossible to distinguish the locations of the associated (periodically distributed) nuclear interactions, and 2. the associated energy release is initiated through a coherent release of energy and charge at the crystal boundaries.",,,,,,

"The Ion Band State Theory describes Fleischmann and Pons cold fusion phenomena. It is based on application of solid state band theory physics, many-body physics, and the known quantum behavior of hydrogen in metals. Important assumptions are that charge neutrality exists in each unit cell and that the reactive quantum states, which are stationary Bloch states, are describable as symmetric sums over complete sets of non-stationary, particle-like Wannier states. Consequences are that D+-D+ wave function overlap occurs for crystals possessing a sufficiently large number Ncell > ~10^4 of unit cells. Once this condition is met, small crystals provide more power per cc than larger crystals. Energy-transfer from the product state to the lattice electrons results from a change in the quantum of mass and resulting inelastic scattering due to charge distribution changes in the boundary region. The theory also predicts that the primary product is 4He, as observed.",,,,,,

"Abstract-- Solids, at room temperature, are periodically ordered. High temperature plasma's (HTP's) are disordered. Because of this fact, collisions i n solids and HTP' s are very different. Specifically, because solids have periodic order, they can coherently absorb momentum, all at once at a point, discontinuously, and through recoil processes in which the solid, as a whole, moves in response to a collision at an isolated location. As a result, in ordered solids, very often, the initial momentum of ""colliding"" particles is not conserved by the particles during ""collisions. "" At lowlintermediate temperatures, these kinds of ""collisions"" play a dominant role i n the following important effects: 1 . the conduction of heat and electricity (Ashkroft and Mermin, 1 976A), 2. diffraction of neutrons, electrons and X-rays (Ashkroft and Mermin, 1 976B), and 3 . the Mossbauer effect (Schwinger, 1990; Schwinger, 1 994). Because the idealized limit of stoichiometric PdD is periodically ordered, not only is there reason to believe that further D-loading will result in the occupation of ion band states by D-nuclei. it is probable that the potential nuclear reactions and transport of ion band state D (Chubb and Chubb, 1 991) will be dominated by these kinds of interactions. . . .",,,,,,

"We argue that much of the debate concerning ""Cold Fusion"" (CF) has resulted from the misguided assumption that CF somehow must mimic a colder version of conventional fusion. Instead we suggest that CF is the result of phenomena that are most intense at absolute temperature T equal to zero, and that these effects persist at room temperature. This alternative approach makes good physical sense because it is unreasonable to believe that particle-particle collisions can provide a mechanism for overcoming the conventional ""Coulomb B arrier"" at room temperature as many have assumed (Lindley, 1 990; Chechin et aI, 1 994). Instead, we suggest that the possible avenues to fusion are the result of coherent, many-body effects that are tied to the underlying, well-known rules of solid-state physics as they apply to periodically ordered lattices. In the paper, we provide an overview of the logic associated with this alternative framework and suggest a number of new , lower T experiments in which pronounced anomalous behavior could result from D+D->4He reactions.",,,,,,

ND band state D+ ions are treated as a sum over pairs. The wave functions of a D+ pair is assumed to be a product of a Bloch function in lattice space times a Bloch function in separation space. Overlap allows a strong force fusion reaction to 4He++. A coupling between the nuclear change and the ion charge distribution in the lattice is described. The change in ion charge distribution scatters Bloch electrons in a multistep nuclear de-excitation process.,,,,,,

"Introduction Cold Fusion has been plagued with misconceptions about what is and is not possible, based on the ""Laws"" of Quantum Mechanics. An important reason for this is the seemingly impossibly large difference in length-scale between nuclear- and atomic- processes. In conventional fusion, these scales remain ""so far apart"" that they ""effectively"" don’t ""talk"" to each other, usually. However, electromagnetic interactions (EMI’s) have infinite range. For this reason, it is possible that EMI’s ""can"" ""explain"" how this ""apparent"" problem can be eliminated.",,,,,,

"Abstract In Cold Fusion, confusion exists as a result of conflicting intuitive pictures, one based on local physics, the other on non-local physics. The local picture, based on particle-particle interaction, has played a dominant role. The non-local ""less-intuitive"" picture, based on the known behavior of solids, places greater emphasis on the behavior of matter distributions and their interaction with the associated environment. The resulting description is consistent with the known laws of physics and the behavior of hydrogen, deuterium (D+) and tritons in transition metals. In the non-local picture, we examine consequences of fluxes of deuterons passing through the surfaces of transition metals as associated with the occupation of D+ ion band states and possible nuclear energy release.",,,,,,

"For a long time, Cold Fusion (CF) seemed to be at odds with conventional Physics both experimentally and theoretically. A key reason for this involved confusion about the possibility that processes involving characteristic length scales of nuclear- and atomic- size dimensions could couple to each other without releasing high momentum particles. As experiments have improved, this situation has changed. In the paper, we identify and contrast a number of common themes associated with the manner in which five of the more refined theories have addressed this problem.",,,,,,

"Surfaces have a huge impact on the physics and chemistry of solids. Changes in surfaces (or other boundaries of a solid), in particular, can be related to changes in the local (""chemical"") environment. In the idealized limit, in which surfaces are defined as ""boundaries"" associated with a lack of, or accumulation of charge, dynamical effects at surfaces can be used and are required (by the associated coupling to external electromagnetic fields) to relate seemingly unrelated local and non-local effects. Thus, counter-intuitive ideas about local and non-local effects can become dominant. In particular, in PdH or PdD, provided external forces are applied uniformly, it is entirely possible for hydrogen (p) or deuterium (d) nuclei to acquire a common phase (a broken gauge symmetry1) and to ""become wave-like"" and interact coherently, through the electromagnetic field, simultaneously, but an-isotropically at the boundaries of a PdD or PdH substrate, or at isolated locations within either substrate. Also, these effects can create coupling between localized and delocalized forms of interaction. We use these and related effects as the basis for suggesting new experiments that have bearing on the findings of Iwamura et al, concerning the ""apparent"" transmutation of Cs to Pr.",,,,,,

The physics of atom Bose-Einstein condensates in optical lattices teaches that superfluid behavior occurs when the potential barriers between adjacent potential wells permit high tunneling rates and the well potentials are shallow. These superfluids have fractional occupation of individual wells. Well periodic symmetry is not affected by the presence of the atoms.

"Conventional Condensed Matter physics provides a unifying framework for understanding Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR’s) in solids. In the paper, standard many-body physics techniques are used to illustrate this fact. Specifically, the paper shows that formally the theories by Schwinger, Hagelstein, and Chubb and Chubb (C&C), all can be related to a common set of equations, associated with reaction rate and energy transfer, through a standard many-body physics procedure (R-Matrix theory). In each case, particular forms of coherence are used that implicitly provide a mechanism for understanding how LENR’s can proceed without the emission of high energy particles. In addition, additional ideas, associated with Conventional Condensed Matter physics, are used to extend the earlier Ion Band State (IBS) model by C&C. The general model clarifies the origin of coherent processes that initiate LENR’s, through the onset of ion conduction that can occur through ionic fluctuations in nanoscale crystals. In the case of PdDx , these fluctuations begin to occur as x -> 1 in sub-lattice structures with characteristic dimensions of 60 nm. The resulting LENR’s are triggered by the polarization between injected d’s and electrons (immediately above the Fermi energy) that takes place in finite-size PdD crystals. During the prolonged charging of PdDx , the applied, external electric field induces these fluctuations through a form of Zener tunneling that mimics the kind of tunneling, predicted by Zener, that is responsible for possible conduction (referred to as Zener-electric breakdown) in insulators. But because the fluctuations are ionic, and they occur in PdD, nano-scale structures , a more appropriate characterization is Zener-ionic breakdown in nano-crystalline PdD. Using the underlying dynamics, it is possible to relate triggering times that are required for the initiation of the effect, to crystal size and externally applied fields.",,,,,,

"ABSTRACT The Iwamura et al. 2-alpha addition transmutations1 and the Oriani-Fisher energetic particle showers2 demand an explanation. They both depend on the same physics as responsible for cold fusion, namely the coherent partitioning of deuteron charge when the deuteron assumes a Bloch-like form and becomes distributed among a large number Nwell of potential wells. As a result the work required to bring the 2 ""nuclei"" into contact is reduced by 1/Nwell. In cold fusion 2 spin-zero paired deuterons fuse as per 2 D+Bloch --> 4He++Bloch + 23.8 MeV. In the Iwamura process 2 4He++Bloch fuse as per 2 4He++Bloch --> 8Be4+Bloch + Enuc, in a Bloch-sensitive reaction where reaction energy Enuc is a function of Nwell. . . .",,,,,,

"There seem to be 3 different processes by which deuterons can be made to fuse so as to release nuclear energy. The conventional approach is thermonuclear fusion, which uses collisions between energized deuterons to create a transient 4He nucleus that decays by energetic particle emission. Deuteron-deuteron (dd) fusion is modeled by scattering theory. Quantum wave mechanics uses wave functions to describe the colliding particles as plane waves. The waves are treated as if arriving from infinity, and as going away to infinity after scattering or reaction. Gamow factors calculating the probability of transmission through the dd Coulomb barrier are used in calculating fusion rates.",,,,,,

"The interface theory of cold fusion is a variant of Ion Band State (IBS) Theory. It models Bloch symmetry deuterons in a 2-dimensional metal lattice instead of the 3-dimensional metal lattice first used. Both IBS variants recognize that the required lattice symmetry has limited extent, with the reactive deuterons being bound inside a closed volume like a box. The reactive deuterons are confined within classical turning point boundaries, while within the box their density distributions are modulated by a lattice array potential. Strictly speaking, the IBS fusion theory is a many-body theory. Nuclear dd fusion is one of several LENR processes. Some LENR processes do not require many-body ions and support room temperature nuclear reactions using light ions in single-particle Bloch geometry. For example, the decay of metastable single-body Bloch-function 8Be seems to be the source of MeV alphas in Oriani's light/heavy water electrolysis, and in several co-deposition electrolysis CR39 studies, as described in ICCF14 Abstracts. The Oriani MeV alphas are side products of both light water and heavy water electrolysis, using either Pd or Ni cathodes, as shown in highly repeatable tests. Bloch 8Be is likely the nuclearly reactive component in the final step of the Iwamura et al. transmutation studies. Despite differences, all LENR systems seem to share some essential physics.",,,,,,

Two important reasons for this are related to: 1. Misconceptions about what was taking place in the experiments, and 2. Limitations of conventional energy band theory. In particular, we proposed the idea that deuterium nuclei (deuterons) could occupy energy band states (ion band states)--analogous to the kinds of energy band states that electrons occupy in ordered solids--with the possibility of nuclear fusion. But conventional energy band theory has limitations, associated with the underlying quantum mechanics. In particular, band theory involves single-particle quasi-particle wave functions.",,,,,,

Schwinger pointed out that under some circumstances the Coulomb barrier between paired charged particles is replaced by a correlation factor in a two-body wave function. This paper shows how having two deuterons bound within a common volume having a multiplicity of potential wells can lead to an energy-minimized Schwinger form of wave equation with wave function overlap. Relevance to a situation in which a small number of deuterium atoms is forced into a fully loaded palladium deuteride (PdD) host is discussed.,,,,,,

"solid, a firestorm of controversy erupted. Beginning in 1991, the Office of Naval Research began a decade-long study of the FP excess heat effect. This effort documented the fact that the excess heat that FP observed is the result of a form of nuclear fusion that can occur in solids at reduced temperature, dynamically, through a deuteron (d)+d4He reaction, without high-energy particles or gamma rays. A key reason this fact has not been accepted is the lack of a cogent argument, based on fundamental physical ideas, justifying it. In the paper, this question is re-examined, based on a generalization of conventional energy band theory that applies to finite, periodic solids, in which d’s are allowed to occupy wave-like, ion band states, similar to the kinds of states that electrons occupy in ordinary metals. Prior to being experimentally observed, the Ion Band State Theory (IBST) of cold fusion predicted a potential d+d => 4He reaction, without high energy particles, would explain the excess heat, the 4He would be found in an unexpected place (outside heat-producing electrodes), and high-loading, x1, in PdDx, would be required.",,,,,,

In fact, a cogent argument does exist, based on resonant electrodynamics, and its more general formulation, involving quantum electrodynamics. Lessons learned from this and their relevance are key to understanding the most salient effects, including the Infra-Red (IR) results from the SPAWAR experiments, and Mitchell Swartz’s experiments. The associated arguments suggest that magnetic effects that have only been indirectly applied may be used to trigger LENR in particular situations. A new experiment, based on this line of reasoning, is suggested.",,,,,,

In addition, energy generation has been observed, always close to the cathode, along with the appearance of new chemical elements in the experimental apparatus. These elements were not present in the cell before the experiment. This observation is proof of nuclear transmutations occurring within the cell.

The detector fulfills all the requirements of cold fusion experiments and, on the other hand, can operate in several kind of experiments involving neutron detection, even when significant, variable and not taggable background is present. As a matter of fact, it is suitable to detect every source emitting multi-MeV neutrons, correlated or not correlated, in burst or constant rate, isotropic or directional. It is a low-noise detector. The detector was used in cold fusion experiments demonstrating, with high sensibility, the absence of neutron emission in these phenomena.",,,,,,

"In a recent report titled ""Observation of abundant heat production from a reactor device and of isotopic changes in the fuel"" and published by Bologna University, G. Levi and co-workers put forth several claims concerning the performance of the so-called E-Cat of inventor Andrea Rossi. High and sustained levels of anomalous heat production are reported in extended tests of a reactor device. These results are based on a calculated temperature of 1400C from infrared camera thermography measurements that assumes gray-body radiation from an alumina surface. We show that when the varying spectral emissivity of alumina is taken into account the calculated temperature is much lower, and estimated power out matches power in to within the experimental error, so resolving this anomaly. Claimed isotopic shift results in the same report derive from material handled by the inventor, and therefore are not independent.",,,,,,

INTRODUCTION,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"This paper summarizes some of the methods applicable for low level tritium detection needed in the search for anomalous fusion in metal hydrides. It is also intended to further detail our tritium and neutron results that have been obtained with the Pd-Si-D system, originally presented at earlier workshops. A measure of reproducibility that was not evident in our previous work has been achieved partially due to the better detection sensitivity afforded by the use of low tritium deuterium and partially from the fact that the foil-wafer cells can be made with nearly identical electrical characteristics. This reproducibility has allowed us to narrow the optimum conditions for the experiment. While this experiment is rather different from the ""standard"" electrolytic cell or the Ti gas hydride experiment, similarities exist in that non equilibrium conditions are sought and the tritium generation levels are low and neutron emission is extremely weak. In contrast to many electrochemical cell experiments, the system used in these experiments is completely sealed during operation and uses no electrolyte.",,,,,,

"An increase in the tritium level was detected in deuterium when various configurations of palladium foil or powder and silicon wafers or powder were subject to a high pulsed current. The deuterium, and over one atmosphere pressure, was circulated in a sealed loop containing the cell and an ionization chamber to measure the tritium increase as a function of time. After 4800 hours of data, spanning 10 cells (including deuterium and hydrogen controls), were collected with this system. Average tritium production has varied from 0.02 to 0.2 nCi/h. Due to experimental constraints we have not been able to measure neutron output with these cells while simultaneously measuring the tritium increase. The question of tritium contamination in the palladium has been primarily resolved by the development of techniques that allow the palladium powder or foil to be reused. Various methods for increasing the tritium production, such as, increased current density, surface modifiers, and higher deuterium loading, will be discussed.",,,,,,

"Over the past year we have been able to demonstrate that a plasma loading method produces an exciting and unexpected amount of tritium from small palladium wires. In contrast to electrochemical hydrogen or deuterium loading of palladium, this method yields a reproducible tritium generation rate when various electrical and physical conditions are met. Small diameter wires (100 - 250 microns) have been used with gas pressures above 200 torr at voltages and currents of about 2000 V at 3-5 A. By carefully controlling the sputtering rate of the wire, runs have been extended to hundreds of hours allowing a significant amount (>10’s nCi) of tritium to accumulate. We will show tritium generation rates for deuterium-palladium foreground runs that are up to 25 times larger than hydrogen-palladium control experiments using materials from the same batch. We will illustrate the difference between batches of annealed palladium and as received palladium from several batches as well as the effect of other metals (Pt, Ni, Nb, Zr, V, W, Hf) to demonstrate that the tritium generation rate can vary greatly from batch to batch.",,,,,,

"ABSTRACT A number of palladium alloys have been loaded with deuterium or hydrogen under low energy plasma bombardment in a system that allows the continuous measurement of tritium. Long run times (up to 200 h) result in an integration of the tritium and this, coupled with the high intrinsic sensitivity of the system (~ 0.1nCi/l), enables the significance of the tritium measurement to be many sigma (>10). We will show the difference in tritium generation rates between batches of palladium alloys (Rh, Co, Cu, Cr, Ni, Be, B, Li, Hf, Hg and Fe) of various concentrations to illustrate that tritium generation rate is dependent on alloy type as well as within a specific alloy, dependent on concentration.",,,,,,

"Cavitation at high frequency in close proximity to metal surfaces was investigated in D2O. A new miniaturized cavitation system was operated at 1.7 MHz and was small enough to fit into a sensitive Seebeck calorimeter. The 1.7 MHz reactor was designed to hold 20 g of D2O or H2O. The cells were operated in a pulsed mode for 1 or 2 min and then allowed to cool in the calorimeter. Target foils were placed in close proximity to the transducer and different foils show a maximum of about 13% change in measured excess heat output. Tritium measurements were made on the resulting liquid and showed a small initial increase. However, longer runs did not show a linear increase in tritium as the cavitation times were increased. No detectable signals were measured on a pancake gamma detector placed below the cavitation cells. Many different target foils (TF) (7 x 19 x 0.1 mm) were run in the system. A few showed some interesting surface features.",,,,,,

"Over the last few years some progress has been made in demonstrating reproducible heat production in so called Cold Fusion experiments . This has not been matched by theoretical understanding as to the mechanism of heat production. It is important to establish which nuclear reactions, if any, are the source of excess heat before speculating on reaction mechanisms . Unfortunately experiment has not clearly demonstrated the consumption of any nuclear fuel nor production of nuclear ash. So any analysis must be able to cope with incomplete data . A computer is an ideal tool to cope with this problem. . . .",,,,,,

"The strongest objection to ""cold fusion"" research since 1989 has been the assertion by nuclear theorists that low-energy nuclear reactions (LENR) ""violate everything known about nuclear physics."" We argue to the contrary that LENR are consistent with quantum mechanics (QM), and ""violate"" only various questionable assumptions of the 30+ established models of nuclear structure theory. In fact, these ""models"" are known to be mutually-contradictory (a liquid nuclear interior in the liquid-drop model [LDM], a gaseous-phase in the shell model; local cluster formations in the alpha-particle model, no local interactions in the Fermi-gas model; a short-range nuclear force in the LDM, a long-range ""effective"" force in the shell model; etc.) and clearly indicate that nuclear theory itself is unfinished business.",,,,,,

Using those lattice structures, the favorable modes of fission have been simulated and the fission fragments compared with the transmutation products, as reported by Mizuno [2]. It is shown that (i) the changes in relative abundance of the Pd isotopes, and (ii) the main transmutation products in Mizuno-style LENR studies are consistent with the idea that the bulk of the energy released in such experiments is due to the fission of Palladium isotopes.",,,,,,

"Models of the Atomic Nucleus (2nd Edition, Springer, 2010) is an attempt to unify the diverse and mutually-contradictory models of traditional nuclear structure theory within the framework of a lattice of nucleons. At the level of nuclear ""modeling"", the lattice is rather successful at reproducing the major features of the historical models. To wit, the binding energies and nuclear radii predictions of the liquid-drop model [LDM] are reproduced in a close-packed lattice because the lattice is dominated by near-neighbor, two-body, nucleon-nucleon interactions, as in the LDM. The alpha particle substructure of nuclei, as postulated in the cluster models, is reproduced in a nucleon lattice with spin- and isospin-layering because a close-packed lattice inherently contains He4-like, tetrahedral nucleon clusters. Most importantly, the shells, subshells and ""magic"" numbers of the independent-particle model [IPM] are reproduced in the lattice on a purely geometrical basis – a direct consequence of nucleon build-up from a central tetrahedron. That fact was noted (and illustrated in Physical Review!) by Eugene Wigner in 1937 – who later won the Nobel Prize in Physics explicitly ""for his contributions to the theory of the atomic nucleus [...], particularly through the discovery and application of fundamental symmetry principles"". It is noteworthy that the exact same lattice described by Wigner achieves unification of the modern-day nuclear models using a realistic, short-range, nuclear potential – and not the purely-theoretical, quark-based fiction of a long-range, nuclear ""mean field.""",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"Models of the Atomic Nucleus goes beyond the traditional concerns of nuclear modeling in addressing the still-unexplained topics of the fragment asymmetry in fission, the millisecond instability of the so-called super-heavy nuclei, and the remarkable findings of transmutation of elements in low-energy nuclear reaction [LENR] studies. The book clearly illustrates the fact that, for resolution of any of these and other long-standing controversies in theoretical nuclear physics, it will be necessary to return to the many loose-ends and inconclusive qualitative arguments that have dominated nuclear structure theory since the 1930s.",,,,,,

"Deciphering the many puzzles of low-energy nuclear reactions (LENR) will require not only knowledge of the electromagnetic and chemical environment of the nuclear species that are susceptible to low-energy excitation, but also a detailed understanding of the many-body problem of the atomic nucleus itself. Today most LENR research focuses on the former issues, while nuclear structure theory remains the same conundrum that it has been for 80 years. The essence of the problem is that there has been no self-consistent spatiotemporal description of nuclear structure – and, as a consequence, no reliable framework within which to address the oldest and most outstanding problem in nuclear physics: the nuclear force. The unanswered question in traditional nuclear physics – and the new challenge in LENR – is how to reconcile the short-range nuclear force known from nucleon scattering experiments with the wealth of empirical data on nuclear structure. Despite problems due to the early rejection of spatiotemporal explanations in nuclear physics, 21st century computational power has opened the door to realistic ""molecular dynamics""-style simulations of nuclear structure. Some implications both for LENR and for nuclear physics are discussed.",,,,,,

"Introduction On March 23, 1989, at the University of Utah, Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons announced that they had caused fusion reactions between deuterium nuclei to occur at room temperature, creating a potentially endless and benign source of energy for the world. Of course, this flew in the face of conventional physics, and scientists all over the world hurried to reproduce the effect. The major institutes in the US were unable to do so, and a US Department of Energy (DOE) Energy Research Advisory Panel (ERAB) declared that the effect was not real and that government funding for further research would essentially constitute waste, fraud, and abuse. Thus died the hope of cheap, endless energy through ""cold fusion,"" at least as far as the regular scientific community was concerned.",,,,,,

Abstract,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"A series of low cost, low precision experiments were conducted to screen for factors which may affect the successful observation of heat from palladium/ heavy water electrolytic cells. Critical factors include the selection of the palladium and the experimental protocol during the initial loading to the beta phase. It was found that bubble patterns, volume expansion, and surface appearance can be used as early predictors of ultimate success. Since large scale defects are detrimental, methods of avoiding cracking are discussed. These include alloying, preparing a uniform surface, loading at a slow rate at low temperatures, delaying use of additives to the electrolyte, and uniform loading techniques. Methods of achieving the later and larger heat releases were found to include: rapid increase in the current density above a threshold value and raising the temperature. A reflux calorimeter design is presented that allows for continuous studies at boiling temperatures of the electrolyte. Unexpected and unexplained occurrences of heat bursts by magnetic fields and radio frequency fields are reported.",,,,,,

These triggering techniques include changes in cell temperature, pulsing the current to electrolytic systems, acoustical stimulation of gas systems, chemical triggering of electrolytic system, pressure changes, radio frequency excitation, magnetic field variations and laser stimulation. Laser stimulation is found to be a potentially fruitful technique to trigger heat events, to probe the cathode surface by scanning for active locations and to compare products from at active and inactive regions.",,,,,,

The method is patterned after mathematics used in Michaelis-Menten kinetic models, which are standard in enzyme catalytic studies. Hydrogen is found to inhibit the deuterium reaction rates and can be explained by mixed inhibition kinetics where the hydrogen both competes with deuterium at the active sites requiring higher concentrations of deuterium for a given reaction rate and it also undergoes noncompetitive inhibition, which alters the maximum rate of the reaction. This kinetic model predicts that hydrogen contamination would require ligher loading ratios for similar reaction rates or heat production and also such contamination may lower ultimate heat production due to hydrogen active site complex productions.",,,,,,

The theory describes correctly the observed target material dependence of the screening energies, underestimating, however, the absolute values by about a factor of 2. Applying an effective screening energy approach, the theoretical cross-sections, thick-target yields as well as nuclear reaction rates have been calculated down to the energies corresponding to the conditions of so-called cold-fusion experiments. This allows for a comparison of the experimental results at higher energies with those achieved in the heavy-water electrolysis experiments.",,,,,,

"The enhanced electron screening effect observed in accelerator experiments for the 2H(d,p)3H and 2H(d,n)3He reaction in deuterized metallic targets may be a breakthrough in understanding the phenomenon of cold fusion. The dielectric function theory enables an extrapolation of experimental cross sections determined at higher energies down to room temperature, leading to an enhancement of the fusion reaction rates by a factor of 1040 compared to the value predicted for the deuterium molecule. An additional enhancement can be obtained due to a 0+ resonance which should exist in the compound nucleus 4He very close to the D-D reaction threshold. Combination of both processes offers a simple explanation of high penetration probability through the Coulomb barrier and the reaction branching ratio preferring the 4He channel in heavy-water electrolysis experiments.",,,,,,

"Energetics Technologies (ET) was recently established to investigate possibilities for inducing Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR) using special wave excitation. Four experimental approaches are being pursued: electrolysis, glow-discharge, gas loading in catalyst cells and high-pressure high-temperature cell with ultrasonic wave excitation. The experimental setups developed by ET are described along with preliminary results obtained. A significant amount of excess heat was measured in the first glow discharge experiment. The power generated during the experiment was up to 3.9 times the input power. When driven with waves the excess heat was higher than when driven with DC. A significant amount of excess heat was also measured after the shutdown of the glow discharge; it lasted for approximately 10 hours. The total excess energy generated is estimated to be 6.7 times the input energy. The ""heat-after-death"" phenomenon was also observed in another glow discharge experiment. Excess heat up to approximately 80% was measured over a period of over 3 months in yet another glow discharge experiment. Driving the electrolytic cells with waves resulted in a faster loading than when driving them with DC of the same average current. The tritium concentration in the electrolyte measured at the end of the experiments was found to be up to more than 100% the pre-experiment level. No excess heat was measured, so far, in the catalyst cells. Successful loading of Pd target with D was obtained in the high-pressure high-temperature gas cell without going through the alpha+beta phase of the Pd-D system.",,,,,,

Several of the successful foils were provided by Dr. Vittorio Violante of ENEA Frascatti. Significant Excess Heat: The output power exceeded the input power (COP) by at least 100%. Maximum COP obtained is 600%, it lasted for 24.5 hours. The longest period of Excess Heat obtained was 134 hours at COP of 150%. A new type of experiments was initiated. Electrolytic loaded Pd cathode is exposed to Ultra Sonic waves (US), inducing cavitations in the vicinity of the cathode.",,,,,,

The ultrasonic transmitters induce cavitation in the electrolyte in the vicinity of the palladium cathode for in-situ cleaning and activation of the cathode surface, generation of dislocations, assistance in loading and excitation of the Pd-D system. The ultrasonically assisted electrolysis cells are described and excess heat generating experiments using these cells are illustrated. All of these experiments used the Dardik’s modified SuperWaves to drive the electrolysis. The reproducibility of excess heat generation obtained using the ultrasonically assisted electrolysis experiments approaches 80%, which is the highest of all types of electrolysis experiments performed at Energetics Technologies.",,,,,,

We believe that one of the most important reasons for these results is the use t of complex fractally nested current excitation From this perspective, these results in replicating the production of excess heat are a further confirmation that natural phenomena, including the electrochemical processes for producing excess of heat, can be correctly described by these fractal dynamics. . In this paper I describe basic concepts of the SuperWaves™ theory, which is an original general approach to model and understand natural phenomena.",,,,,,

Excess heat was produced at the rate of about 1.2 watts during electrolysis of heavy water with a titanium cathode weighing 0.0625g. Analysis of the electrodes before and after electrolysis with a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) revealed that new surface topographical features with concentrations of unexpected elements (V, Cr, Fe, Ni, and Zn) formed during electrolysis. The morphology and microcomposition of palladium after electrolysis in heavy water were studied. Fibers which appeared on the surface were observed to change with time.

"ABSTRACT Hydrogen loading of 99.98% pure natural uranium foils (0.18 mm thick) was performed by aqueous electrolysis in order to compare with glow discharge results. Alpha, beta, and gamma specific radioactivity were measured after hydrogen loading and compared with the control. Some of the samples revealed an increase of the specific radioactivity of up to 20%. Gamma ray spectroscopy was also performed on the samples. Results reveal an increase of the specific counts for the peaks of Th234 and U235 and a decrease in the U Ka1 characteristic x-ray peak. The surface topography changed from granular before electrolysis to pitted afterward. The thorium concentration increased slightly after electrolysis compared with the original material. In summary, this work in progress reveals that loading hydrogen into uranium increases the uranium decay rate, in agreement with the glow discharge results.",,,,,,

"The presence of localized concentrations of anomalous elements (gold and silver)on the surfaces of palladium cathodes after electrolysis in either light water or heavy water electrolyte was first reported in 1994 [1]. Similarly, anomolous elements in surface pits were reported for titanium cathodes after electrolysis in heavy water electrolyte [2]. More recently, off-the-shelf battery fluid (Sp.G. 1.26) was substituted for analytical-grade H2SO4 (Sp.G. 1.84) in the electrolyte. Silver was found in localized concentrations on palladium cathodes after electrolysis. These results are consistent with a thermal neutron mechanism proposed previously [1].",,,,,,

The microstructure of Pd and Ti foils was altered by cold rolling followed by heating at temperatures up to ~700Ã‚°C. The surface topography and microchemical composition of these foils was studied before and after electrolysis with heavy water electrolyte. Temperature measurements during electrolysis showed that Ti and Pd cathodes which had been heated to ~700Ã‚°C gave about 1W excess power relative to a control.,,,,,,

"Conventionally, the cold fusion reaction produces heat. The authors have sought a different approach, wherein the device has no input energy, relying on the energy produced by cold fusion in the device. The device consists of diodes fabricated as powder, with a large surface junction made up of a semiconductor in contact with palladium charged with deuterium.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"The apparent fusion reactions take place in the junction between the semiconductor and the Palladium powder, which produces an excitation which is transmitted to the electrons. This excitation increases their energy and allows them to cross the bandgap of the semiconductor and pass into the conduction band, as in a photovoltaic cell. This energy very quickly appears as a spontaneous potential difference which can reach over 0.5 volt per junction.",,,,,,

"The potential drop concentrates on the junction region, and at a nano scale the electric field reaches considerable values, higher than the megavolt per meter, which constrains the deuterium nuclei and increases the probability of deuterium fusion.",,,,,,

It explains a large number of observed anomalous effects in LENR by positing that nuclear rest-masses can vary in ""nuclear active environments"" in condensed matter settings. The varying masses modify the kinematic constraints of the nuclear reactions. It also offers a mechanism for enhancing electron screening and-or quantum tunneling rates, for allowing for resonant tunneling, and for modified radioactive decay rates by mass changes in the decaying isotopes.",,,,,,

"Proton conductors (PC) are metal oxides often used as solid electrolyte with hydrogen above 400 K, in which anomalous presence increase of several chemical elements and excess heat would have been obtained from near-surface locations. Near the surface of other metal oxides, closely spaced hydrogen at a distance of only 2 pm at least during a fraction of the time has been detected, and has been proposed to be in the form of hypothetical ultradense Rydberg matter H(0). How can H(0) form in PC near the cathode interface? Nanometric cavities (NC) were observed in the PC near their cathode interfaces. These NC would contain H2 precipitates with impurities, under a pressure of the order of 0.1 GPa. Since PC are crossed by a large flux of protons, a simple mechanism is proposed to increase the H2 pressure in these NC rapidly and temporarily well above the PC tensile strength. A second mechanism is then described to turn this H2 into a metallic-molecular state, form a Rydberg matter H(1) and then H(0) with a pressure decrease. In NC, the presence of impurities and the entry of the hydrogen atoms in the form of Rydberg atoms are proposed to decrease the pressure required to form metallic-molecular hydrogen. Finally, different experiments are proposed to test this research approach, particularly by transmission electron microscopy and Raman micro-spectroscopy.",,,,,,

"Since 1992 the ENEA Frascati Group has performed successful experiments aimed to measuring the excess heat produced in electrolytic cells with heavy water and a Palladium cathode. These experiments were characterized by a substantial lack of reproducibility. On the other side, it has become more and more clear that reaching, and possibly exceeding, a threshold in the amount of Deuterium absorbed in the lattice (usually called the DlPd ratio) is a necessary condition in order to produce excess heat (DlPd ~ 0.9 atomic). These considerations pushed the Group to concentrate its activity in the study of the connection between the Palladium characteristic parameters and the maximum reachable D/Pd ratio, by analysing and interpreting the relative absorption mechanisms. Mastering this aspect of the experiment should allow obtaining reproducibly high charging ratios, well above the quoted threshold, and thus hopefully reproducible production of heat excess.",,,,,,

We have studied the influence of the microstructure of Pd samples on the features of the Hydrogen(Deuterium) loading process in order to improve the reproducibility of excess heat experiments.,,,,,,

"We have found that the Pd grain size is a significative parameter affecting in a strong way both the loading kinetics and the maximum concentration. A careful check of the microstructure appears thus necessary in order to obtain high loading ratios. We make the hypothesis that this can be related to the role of the grain size both on the density of short circuit paths for fast diffusion and on the mechanical properties of the material, which influence the metal ability in relaxing the stress field generated at the sample surface by the solute concentration gradient.",,,,,,

"Abstract The resources dedicated by ENEA to Cold Fusion research in the last two years have been strongly reduced. Nevertheless, fruitful activity has been performed following two main lines. The first line attains to the effort for reaching high values of D/Pd ratio in Pd in order to obtain the best conditions for cold fusion phenomena, in particular power excess production in electrolytic cells. The outcome of this research is the definition of the starting characteristic of Pd (metallurgy), and the procedure for its loading with Deuterium. The calorimetry by now assessed at ENEA Frascati has been used for the detection of power excess. The second line concerns the attempt to detect in a clear way the production of 4He during the power excess episodes. A system aimed to the analysis of the gases evolving from the electrolytic cell is being realised and will be briefly described.",,,,,,

The excess heat is signaled by the local temperature rise, measured by a commercial Peltier element in good thermal contact with the thin film cathode substrate. In order to detect the very small amount of 4He expected in the gas mixture exiting from the cell, we remove effectively all non inert components of the gas mixture (especially hydrogen isotopes) with a non-evaporable getter (NEG) pump. . . .",,,,,,

Our results suggest that most of the transition metals can exhibit ferromagnetic ordering if the lattice is placed in sufficiently high tensile stress. These results are applied to the study of some layered structures employed by a number of Low Energy Nuclear Reaction (LENR) research teams and may help to explain some of the anomalous results and the difficulty in reproduction of those results.",,,,,,

Nuclear transmutations have been reported to occur in matrices subjected to either electrochemical or gas loading at room temperature. To overcome the difficulties of the large Coulomb repulsion among nuclei a γ-ray electromagnetic field appears as a suitable agent. It is discussed whether this e.m. excitation could emerge from cold fusion processes and induce nuclear reactions through the giant resonance coupling of this e.m. field with the closed shells present in the nuclei of the matrix.,,,,,,

"In March 2021 the author started a replication of the Frank Gordon's and Harper Whitehouse's Lattice Energy Converter (LEC), as described at the RNBE 2020 conference and later at ICCF23 and subsequently discussed in detail on lenr-forum.com. The most interesting feature of this device was its simplicity and apparently its high reproducibility (the device was already replicated by other researchers). In designing the experiments the first concern was to exclude any parasitic effect due to electromagnetic interferences, noise, instrumentation drift and other conventional (but not obvious) effects. To this end, a series of control experiments were designed and performed before the actual replication. The second aim was to design a very simple structure that can be easily modified and reutilized in order to allow a variety of tests.",,,,,,

"In this paper, a simple Zitterbewegung electron model, proposed in a previous work, is presented from a different perspective based on the principle of mass-frequency equivalence. A geometric-electromagnetic interpretation of mass, relativistic mass, De Broglie wavelength, Proca, Klein-Gordon, Dirac and Aharonov-Bohm equations in agreement with the model is proposed. A non-relativistic, Zitterbewegung interpretation of the 3.7 keV deep hydrogen level found by J. Naudts is presented. According to this perspective, ultra-dense hydrogen can be conceived as a coherent chain of bosonic electrons with protons or deuterons located in the center of their Zitterbewegung orbits. This approach suggests a possible role of ultra-dense hydrogen in some aneutronic and many-body low energy nuclear reactions.",,,,,,

At both ends of the palladium wire considerable changes are observed in the form of blowouts (resembling congealed ""Solar protuberances"") of molten metal with complex elemental composition. The palladium surface proved to be covered with small particles, approximately 1–2 ìm in size, composed of rhenium oxide Re2O7 , while near the cracks and fractures the surface was covered with rhenium, carbon and oxygen crystallites of hexagonal symmetry. The entire surface of the rhenium sample became cracked and coated with a thick layer of carbon compounds with rhenium as RexCy . The phenomenological model of nuclear reactions leading to the observed elemental composition of rhenium and palladium is discussed.",,,,,,

Recent studies on gas-loading of Pd nanoparticle materials have demonstrated consistent and repeatable anomalous heat production in the presence of deuterium gas [1-4]. Our group has confirmed anomalous heat production in zeolite and alumina powders containing Pd nanoparticles and found additional features. Investigations at low pressure and slow loading showed a clear association between exothermic and endothermic features and the presence of specific chemical species. These provide insight into the underlying mechanisms and the crucial question as to the origins of the anomalous heat.,,,,,,

Earlier studies [1,2] have shown that a hydrogen-deuterium (H/D) exchange chemical reaction can account for at least some of excess heat observed during gas-loading experiments. In this work we show that excess heat contributed by H/D exchange can be eliminated by prebaking the material in vacuum at 390°C, due to the removal of residual water from the material. After the material is given the opportunity to reabsorb water from air the reaction and excess heat production in the presence of deuterium resumes. Our calculations on the energy available from H/D exchange show that all the excess heat observed during our experiment can be accounted for by this chemical reaction.",,,,,,

"Numerous reports on gas loading of hydrogen isotope into powdered materials indicate excess heat generation that could be the result of a low energy nuclear reaction (LENR). When the amount of generated heat is small, it is important to characterize the calorimeter to account for possible measurement errors, or artifacts, which can result in long-term apparent excess heat. In this paper we investigate one of those possible measurement artifacts applicable to the gas loading systems that (1) use thermometry as a proxy for energy flow measurements, and (2) run at elevated temperatures. When loading gas into Pd-impregnated alumina, we have found that thermal gradients inside the system result in apparent heating or cooling of the measuring system. We experimentally magnified this effect and confirmed that it was due to temperature nonuniformity inside the calorimetric system. We quantified the effect using a numerical simulation tool to show that a temperature gradient as small as 0.5 K/m might result in 50 mW of apparent excess heat",,,,,,

"Density functional theory was applied to study the hydrogen/deuterium evolution reaction on the palladium surface. High deuterium loading ratio ( > 0.9 ) has been identified as a necessary condition for initiating low energy nuclear reaction in palladium material. However, electrochemical loading of deuterium to the concentrations above 0.75 has its own challenges. While loading concentrations above 0.95 have been reported, the mechanism responsible for such elevated loading levels is still unknown. Our recent experiments gave an indication that the use of certain dopants modifies the process of deuterium adsorption on palladium surfaces. Such modifications promote deuterium loading to higher concentrations. We provide a detailed explanation on how the presence of dopants changes the activation overpotential and alter the deuterium escape kinetics during the evolution reaction.",,,,,,

"We have used density functional theory (DFT) to investigate crucial material parameters that can promote a low energy nuclear reaction (LENR). This approach significantly decreases the experimental burden involved into material fabrication and testing. It also provides the foundation for systematical study and optimization of important material properties. We focused on three characteristics to describe the LENR environment: (1) a high hydrogen isotope loading ratio, (2) the presence of dopants or impurities, and (3) material morphology. We chose two figures of merit to characterize those environments: hydrogen adsorption energy on metal surface and H2 bond length. We showed that high hydrogen loading and the presence of impurities in Pd and Ni can lower the adsorption energy, thus increasing hydrogen surface mobility potentially improving the reaction rate. Another factor that would increase the fusion probability is the distance between two hydrogen atoms. We demonstrated that a hydrogen molecule can be formed in a near-surface void in Pd and Ni at the bond length of 0.70–0.74 Å.",,,,,,

"The Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Science (SC) was approached in late 2003 by a group of scientists who requested that the Department revisit the question of scientific evidence for low energy nuclear reactions. In 1987 Pons and Fleischman first reported the production of ""excess"" heat in a Pd electrochemical cell, and postulated that this was due to D-D fusion (D=deuterium), sometimes referred to as ""cold fusion."" The work was reviewed in 1989 by the Energy Research Advisory Board (ERAB) of the DOE. ERAB did not recommend the establishment of special programs within DOE devoted to the science of low energy fusion, but supported funding of peer-reviewed experiments for further investigations. Since 1989, research programs in cold fusion have been supported by various universities, private industry, and government agencies in several countries. . . .",,,,,,

"Claims of excess power produced in electrochemical cells have been made by many investigators including those from two Navy laboratories. The excess power reportedly occurs in palladium electrodes highly loaded with deuterium. Other anomalous effects such helium-4, tritium and low energy radiation production have also been reported. This report summarizes the experimental results from a number of electrochemical loading/calorimetric experiments on palladium electrodes run at NRL. The experiments were carried out with the purpose of replicating the published excess power results obtained at the other Navy laboratories and with the goal of identifying the experimental conditions necessary to produce anomalous effects. Most of the experiments described were attempts to electrolytically load pure palladium or palladium alloy cathodes with deuterium (or hydrogen) and then to measure the power produced in the electrolytic cells. Loading was monitored in situ by measuring the change in the axial resistance of the cathode and comparing the measure values with the known relationship between resistance and the D(H)/Pd atomic ratios. While attaining high levels of deuterium loading in palladium cathodes was difficult we found that using materials with a large grain microstructure facilitated the loading. Calorimetric measurements on the highly loaded cathodes were initially made in isoperibol calorimeters that had a sensitivity of ±10%. No excess power (200 mW) and no radiation above the background were measured in any of the experiments described. Highly sensitive heat conduction calorimeters were evaluated for their use with the electrochemical cells. Results showed that measurements at the ±10 mW level were possible in the heat conduction calorimeters when data were collected frequently and signal averaging was used. Another experiment that was investigated was the electrochemical codeposition of palladium and deuterium on cathodes. Again, no radiation above background levels was detected in these experiments.",,,,,,

Cathode micro structure is determined by thermomechanical processing that includes electrode deformation (swaging) and the annealing conditions (time and temperature). Results will be presented on the extent of deuterium loading in rod-shaped (0.4 cm in diameter and 3.5 cm long) cathodes with controlled microstructure produced at The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). Loading on NRL cathodes will be compared with that attained on commercially available electrodes routinely used at other laboratories.,,,,,,

"The generation of excess power in a palladium deuteride electrochemical system is often difficult and time consuming. Long incubation times, on the order of weeks or months, are necessary presumably for the basic electrolyte to dissolve and redeposit essential impurities onto the cathode surface. To accelerate this process, we added chemical additives to the electrolyte once the palladium was loaded with deuterium. Chemicals that produce oxide interfaces on the palladium surface seemed to occasionally produce apparent excess power. A single Pd90Rh10 cathode generated a total apparent excess energy on the order of 10 kJ after a series of additions in an experiment that only took one week. The results are encouraging and may lead to an understanding of what triggers excess power production in Fleischmann-Pons-type experiments. A hypothetical model describing the possible role of oxide interfaces is described.",,,,,,

"The production of excess energy in palladium cathodes electrochemically loaded with deuterium (the Fleischmann–Pons Experiment) has been debated in the literature since its first publication in 1989. In a subset of 61 trials, we electrochemically loaded palladium–rhodium foil cathodes with deuterium from alkaline solutions of heavy water in specially designed closed calorimeter cells. We observed excess energy bursts in the range 2.4–44.3 kJ in 6% of these experiments. Additionally, a conservative estimate of the total integrated output energy is greater than the total integrated input energy in these experiments. This paper documents the steps taken to examine these results thoroughly for calibration/measurement errors and instrumental artifacts. A 2.4 kJ energy burst is at least four times greater than the energy released by oxidizing deuterium in the cell headspace. The data and subsequent elimination of alternative explanations for excess energy production lead us to conclude that the excess energy is real and of yet unknown origin.",,,,,,

After having implanted deuterium for several hours, random neutron emissions are observed and neutron burst are measured by using two identical BF-3 neutron detectors No. 1 and No. 2 located at different positions and a neutron dosemeter. The neutron count rates are up to 100 times higher than the background count of 0.8 count/sec. it is corresponding to neutron flux of (2-8)E+5 neutron/sec. no GammaRay counts beyond background are detected in our experiments.

"A new mechanism of LENR in solids is proposed, which is based on the large amplitude anharmonic lattice vibrations, a.k.a. intrinsic localized modes or ""discrete breathers"" (DBs). In particular, so called gap DBs, which can arise in diatomic crystals such as metal hydrides, are argued to be the LENR catalyzers. The large mass difference between H or D and the metal atoms provides a gap in phonon spectrum, in which DBs can be excited in the H/D sub-lattice resulting in extreme dynamic closing of adjacent H/D atoms ("" 0.01 Å) required for the tunneling through the nuclear Coulomb barrier. DBs have been shown to arise either by thermal activation at elevated temperatures or by knocking atoms out of equilibrium positions under non-equilibrium gas loading conditions, employed under radiolysis or plasma deposition methods. The DB statistics in both cases are analyzed, and an attempt is made to quantify part of the vibrational problem in terms of electrochemical current or ion flux, connecting them with external excitation of DBs that act as nano-colliders of deuterons, triggering LENR. Resulting analytical expressions (under a selected set of material parameters) describe quantitatively the observed exponential dependence on temperature and linear dependence on the electric (or ion) current. Possible ways of engineering the nuclear active environment based on the present concept are discussed.",,,,,,

"In many crystals with sufficient anharmonicity, special kinds of lattice vibrations, namely, discrete breathers (DBs) can be excited either thermally or by external triggering, in which the amplitude of atomic oscillations greatly exceeds that of harmonic oscillations (phonons). Coherency and persistence of large atomic oscillations in DBs may have drastic effect on quantum tunneling due to correlation effects discovered by Schrödinger and Robertson in 1930. These effects have been applied recently to the tunneling problem by Vysotskii et al:, who demonstrated a giant increase of sub-barrier transparency during the increase of the correlation coefficient at special high-frequency periodic action on the quantum system. In the present paper, it is argued that DBs present the most natural and efficient way to produce correlation effects due to time-periodic modulation of the potential well width (or the Coulomb barrier width) and hence to act as breather ‘nano-colliders’ (BNC) triggering low energy nuclear reactions (LENR) in solids. The tunneling probability for deuterium (D–D) fusion in ‘gap DBs’ formed in metal deuterides is shown to increase with increasing numbers of oscillations by 190 orders of magnitude, resulting in the observed LENR rate at extremely low concentrations of DBs.

"In many-body nonlinear systems with sufficient anharmonicity, a special kind of lattice vibration, namely, Localized Anharmonic Vibrations (LAVs) can be excited either thermally or by external triggering, in which the amplitude of atomic oscillations greatly exceeds that of harmonic oscillations (phonons) that determine the system temperature. The coherency and persistence of LAVs may have a drastic effect on quantum tunneling due to correlation effects discovered by Schrödinger and Robertson in 1930. These effects have been applied to the tunneling problem by a number of authors, who demonstrated a giant increase of sub-barrier transparency during the increase of the correlation coefficient at a special high-frequency periodic action on the quantum system. Recently, it has been proposed that discrete breathers (a sub-class of LAVs arising in periodic systems) present the most natural and efficient way to produce correlation effects in regular crystals due to time-periodic modulation of the potential well (or the Coulomb barrier) width and hence to act as breather ‘nano-colliders’ catalyzing low energy nuclear reactions (LENR) in solids. It has been shown that the tunneling probability for D–D fusion under electrolysis of heavy water increases enormously with increasing number of oscillations resulting in the fusion rates comparable with those observed experimentally. In the present paper, we discuss possible ways of engineering the nuclear-active environment (NAE) and catalyzing LENR in NAE based on the LAV concept. We propose some practical ways of catalyzing LENR that are based on a special electro-magnetic treatment or electron and gamma irradiation, which could trigger LAVs in crystals and clusters.",,,,,,

"We propose a mechanism explaining high catalytic activity of quasicrystals (QCs), which is based on unusual dynamics of atoms at special sites in QCs, namely, localized anharmonic vibrations (LAVs) and phasons. With the vibrations, one deals with a large amplitude (fractions of an angstrom) time-periodic oscillations of a small group of atoms around their stable positions in the lattice, known also as discrete breathers, which can be excited in regular crystals as well as in QCs. On the other hand, phasons are a specific property of QCs, which are represented by very large amplitude (angstrom) oscillations of atoms between two quasi-stable positions determined by the geometry of a QC. Large amplitude atomic motion in LAVs and phasons may result in time-periodic driving of adjacent potential wells occupied by hydrogen ions (protons or deuterons). The rate of tunneling of the particle through the potential barrier separating the wells is shown to be drastically enhanced by the driving. These results support the concept of nuclear catalysis in QCs that can take place at special sites provided by their inherent topology.",,,,,,

"Experiments with uranium are presented that show a highly exothermal reaction, which can only be of nuclear origin. One striking point of these results is that they clearly show that what is being observed is not some kind of fusion reaction of the deuterium present (only exceedingly small amounts of it are present). This is a strong indication that hydrogen can trigger nuclear reactions that seem to involve the nuclei of the lattice (which would yield a fission-like pattern of products). Confronted with a situation where some experiments in the field yield a fusion-like pattern of products (CF experiments) and others a fissionlike one (LENR experiments), one can reasonably wonder whether one is not observing two aspects of the same phenomenon. . . .",,,,,,

"Since more than 15 years, unexplained heat effects have been reported in systems involving hydrogen isotopes (hydrogen and deuterium) and certain metals like palladium. The most studied system (palladium/deuterium) has given birth to the ""Cold Fusion"" concept: a special kind of DD fusion reaction, only occurring in a metallic lattice, which yields heat and helium-4 as the main reaction product. Other systems have also been studied (nickel hydrogen and caesium/deuterium for instance), showing shifts in isotopic ratio of the products of reaction and leading to the more generalized concept of Low Energy Nuclear Reaction (LENR). A novel conjecture (the pico-gravity conjecture) is presented here, that may explain all the anomalies observed in this so-called ""Cold Fusion"" field. According to this conjecture, the main part of the energy produced in Low Energy Nuclear Reaction could be the result of a very special kind of chemical reactions (pico-chemical reactions), induced by a considerable increase of gravity at pico-meter distances (pico-gravity). True nuclear signatures (α-particles emission for instance) could also occur according to the pico-gravity conjecture. But they should be many orders of magnitude lower than would be expected from the energy produced (which is observed experimentally). This conjecture will be tested by analysing the products of the reaction of hydrogen isotopes with selected metals.",,,,,,

Robert Bunsen (1811-1899) improved this method in 1870 and designed a calorimeter based on the measurement of the volume rather than the mass of ice melted. Nowadays this method is still used [1] because it is simple, accurate, sensitive and most of all rather insensible to interference, which is a key point in order to have convincing experiment in a controversial field. Moreover, an ice calorimeter is adiabatic and isotherm (0°C) thus suppressing the problem of heat transfer in wires and tubing connecting the experiment to the outside of the calorimeter. It is an integrating calorimeter that measures enthalpy.",,,,,,

"Recently, unexplained enhancements of d/d reaction rates in solids were observed. This enhancement is lower than a factor of 10 at low energies of the deuteron (a few keV) and as high as a factor of 1018 for extremely low energies (0,025 eV). Based on the calculation of d/d reaction rates in a lattice, a phenomenological model is proposed to infer the enhancement that can be expected for deuterons of energies in between these two extremes. A potentially interesting zone (between 500 and 2000 eV) has been identified.",,,,,,

The nuclear signatures that can be expected when contacting hydrogen with fine nickel powders are derived from thermal results recently obtained (Rossi energy amplifier). The initiation of the reactions (either by proton or neutron capture) is not discussed and considered as true. Proposals are made to check the process either by radiation emission measurements or by elemental analysis (ICP-MS),,,,,,

The consequences of either proton or neutron capture have been studied. It was shown that these consequences are not in line with the experimental observations. A novel tentative explanation is thus described. Should this explanation be true? It is proposed to call pico-chemistry the novel field thus opened.",,,,,,

"Sensitive mass flow calorimetry was used in a series of tests to evaluate eight treated NiCuMn (Constantan) wires in a gas loading cell. The goal of this testing was to reproduce and confirm the production of excess heat when using an experimental setup similar to that demonstrated in 2013 by Dr. Francesco Celani at National Instrument’s NI week and ICCF 17. Six of the eight Constantan wires used in the SKINR tests were provided by Dr. Celani and the remaining two were obtained from Mathieu Valat. Initial tests in the series closely followed the set-up, operation, and heating protocols used by Dr. Celani with a significantly modified stainless test cell to enable the use of mass flow calorimetry. Later tests used the same modified test cell but added additional heating protocols using pulsed or highly modulated electric currents (SuperWaves) to enhance hydrogen loading and create additional thermal gradients within the Constantan wires. No excess heat was observed in a calorimeter of a sensitivity <10 mW when running either the initial or later test protocols during  200 days of testing.",,,,,,

"A hypothesis is proposed where low energy nuclear reactions involve three-body recombination of deuterons injected between the nuclei of D2 molecules trapped in a dense lattice of a chemical compound of transition metal and impurity. Two D's fuse to 4He, and the energy is converted by expulsion of the third deuteron. Measurable fusion occurs when two D's are confined within 0.1 angstrom of each other. Three boson (efimov) interactions can have longer range than two boson interactions. The best known example is triple alpha fusion to carbon-12 in stars. Triple deuterium interaction could perhaps be possible in the 0.5-1.0 angstrom range; the distance between D's in a D2 molecule are 0.74 angstrom. The hypothesis accounts for the low reproducibility and short duration of the effect because of rapid destruction of the active structure by sputtering, radiation damage, bubble formation and chemical reduction of the impurities to compounds like D2O, ND3, CD4, or BD3. The hypothesis also accounts for the observed prevalence of 4He >> tritium >> neutrons.",,,,,,

"the deuteron is pushed in between the two D nuclei, and form a hypothetical Efimov-like triple D state. Three-boson (Efimov) interactions can have a longer range than two-boson interactions. Two nuclei fuse to helium and the third is ejected in a three body recombination. In rare cases the result is tritium and helium-3. The NAE might be a semiconductor like silicon, known to incorporate hydrogen molecules. The NAE could perhaps be a compound like MoS2, known as a possible substitute for platinum in electrolytic hydrogen evolution. The NAE might also be an alloy of metals with boron and silicon allowing occlusion of D2 molecules sitting in a tight vice in a narrow lattice. Or the NAE might be palladium oxide/nickel oxide, which are hydrogenating catalysts. Or it might be a chemical compound such as silicon boride and titanium carbide where D2 could sit in vacancies. A triple D might interact with lattice atoms according to the scheme mMen+ (3D)?m+2Men+1 + He, which might lead to the formation of radioactive isotopes.",,,,,,

"EPRI sponsored an experimental program to investigate the idea that heat, and possibly nuclear products, could be created electrolytically in palladium lattices. Observations using high precision mass flow calorimetry revealed that excess heat could be produced in electrochemical cells with palladium cathodes and a heavy water electrolyte in a more or less reproducible manner, when a number of criteria were satisfied. This excess heat generated is far too large to be a chemical or metallurgical transformation. By inference, a nuclear reaction of some as yet undetermined nature is the hypothesized heat source. This report details the observation of excess powers documented in calorimetry experiments.",,,,,,

EPRI sponsored an experimental program to investigate the trace element changes brought about in palladium after extensive electrolysis in heavy water electrolytes. Of particular interest were cathodes which had experienced episodes of excess heat production beyond all electrical and other inputs. This report details the careful analysis of a particular cathode by neutron activation (NAA) as compared with the identical simultaneous analysis of virgin palladium material from which the cathode was fabricated.,,,,,,

"Deuterium concentration and distribution profiles in electrolytically deuterated Ti plates have been obtained by Elastic Recoil Detection (E.R.D. ) , Rutherford Back Scattering (R.B.S. ) and X-ray diffraction (XRD ) . It has been found that D/Ti ratio remains constant (~ 1.65) up to a penetration which depends on the electrolysis time and then it goes down steeply to ~0. 05. The formed deuteride (TiDx, x ~1.65) exhibits some preferred orientations and its texture depends on that of the original Ti plate. The relevance of these data in relation to electrolytic cold fusion experiments is discussed.",,,,,,

"A simple calorimeter has been designed that works at constant temperature; that of boiling water. Heat losses can be estimated accurately with an ohmic heater. As expected, losses are independent of the electric power input to the heater and the amount of evaporated water is linearly dependant on the power input. The device has been used to determine the heating power of a plasma electrolysis (the Ohmori-Mizuno experiment). We confirm that in this experiment, the heat output from electrolysis is greater than the electrical power input. The excess energy increases as the electrolysis voltage is increased from 200 V up to 350 V (400 W input). The excess energy may be as high as 120 W.",,,,,,

"1. The only valid (necessary and sufficient) condition for b-stability of a nucleus is the minimum value of the mass of the atom (not of the nucleus) on the isobar line (that is, atomic weight = const). This condition holds true for all known isotopes without exception. 2. The condition of nuclear stability and the decay schemes of unstable nuclei depend on the state of the electron shells. Atom ionization and other perturbations in electron shells (caused, for example, by magnetic fields) not only changes the decay periods of unstable nuclei [1, 2], but also alters decay schemes [3] and modifies the stability condition. . . .",,,,,,

Implications of this enlarged scope of nuclear physics are explored, including a chain reaction with nuclear fuel 2H that produces energy, 4He, 3H, and a wide range of nuclear transmutations. Natural explanations emerge for these and other nuclear phenomena for which evidence has been accumulating over the past two decades.",,,,,,

"Oriani has shown that electrolysis of ordinary water generates showers of energetic charged particles that can be detected outside the electrolysis cell. Here I attempt to confirm external radiation and to explore some of its properties. Possible sources of error are investigated. Preliminary experiments have not revealed showers, but they suggest that a flux of radiation may be emitted from the cell with an intensity that declines with distance from the cell. Further work with better control of environmental factors is required before a definitive statement can be made. Nuclear reactions and decay products that may be responsible for the radiation remain to be identified.",,,,,,

"It is shown that accurate values of the rates of enthalpy generation in the electrolysis of light and heavy water can be obtained from measurements in simple, single compartment Dewar type calorimeter cells. This precise evaluation of the rate of enthalpy generation relies on the non-linear regression fitting of the ""black-box"" model of the calorimeter to an extensive set of temperature time measurements. The method of data analysis gives a systematic underestimate of the enthalpy output and, in consequence, a slightly negative excess rate of enthalpy generation for an extensive set of blank experiments using both light and heavy water. By contrast, the electrolysis of heavy water at palladium electrodes shows a positive excess rate of enthalpy generation; this rate increases markedly with current density, reaching values of approximately 100 W cm^-3 at approximately 1 A cm^-2. It is also shown that prolonged polarization of palladium cathodes in heavy water leads to bursts in the rate of enthalpy generation; the thermal output of the cells exceeds the enthalpy input (or the total energy input) to the cells by factors in excess of 40 during these bursts. The total specific energy output during the bursts as well as the total specific energy output of fully charged electrodes subjected to prolonged polarization (5-50 MJ cm^-3) is 10^2 - 10^3 times larger than the enthalpy of reaction of chemical processes.",,,,,,

We conclude that all theoretical attempts that concentrate only on few-body interactions, both electromagnetic and nuclear, are probably insufficient to explain such phenomena. On the other hand we find good indications that theories describing collective, coherent interactions among elementary constituents leading to macroscopic quantum-mechanical effects belong to the class of possible theories of those phenomena.",,,,,,

"We have already described elsewhere ( 1 ,2) some of the principles which have guided our search for the generation of high rates of excess enthalpy generation at elevated temperatures, say, up to the boiling points of the electrolytes (3,4) . One of these principles has been the prediction that the partial molar enthalpy of absorption of hydrogen (or deuterium) in palladium (5) will become positive at the high charging ratios (X = DlPd) required for excess enthalpy generation (6,7), see Fig 1.",,,,,,
"Although a transition from exothermic to endothermic absorption is probably not a necessary condition for achieving excess enthalpy generation at elevated temperaturesl , such a transition will certainly facilitate the achievement of high charging ratios. For example, increases of temperature will then themselves lead to increases in X and thereby in the rates of excess enthalpy generation. These are the conditions required for the development of ""positive feedback"" and; in this paper, we report on two lines of investigation which have indicated the presence of these effects. We then outline the way in which our understanding of this phenomenon has guided our investigation of excess enthalpy generation at elevated temperatures.",,,,,,

"Section 1. Introduction I have been asked on several occasions during the last ten years to provide a commentary on subjects such as the Sociology of Science, Social Responsibility in Science etc. with special reference to the topic of ""Cold Fusion"". I have always been reluctant to do so for two principal reasons. The first is that I believe that the consideration of these topics is premature. The reason is that I am convinced that there is much more information which bears on such topics which will be revealed in the fullness of time. Furthermore, there are aspects of the past history, developments and, indeed, of the science which I do not wish to discuss even at the present time. Inevitably, therefore, any such article will be incomplete, will lack focus and will be couched in rather general terms. This is the way the present article has turned out to be; in view of the evident deficiencies, it should only be taken as a first step in trying to develop a discussion of the important Social Issues.",,,,,,

"The scheme of research which led to the start-up of the project now known as ""Cold Fusion"" is illustrated by Fig. 1. We note that it is commonly believed that there is absolutely no way of influencing Nuclear Processes by Chemical means: therefore, any results that demonstrate that this might be possible must be due to faulty experimentation, delusion, fraud etc. However, any enquiry as to the experimental foundation of the first statement in Fig. 1 is normally met by the response: ""because quantum mechanics, Q.M., shows that this is so"". We are driven to the conclusion that this first statement is just part of the belief-system of Natural Scientists and we naturally also have to ask the question; ""what conclusion would we draw if we subject the statement to the dictates of Field Theory?""",,,,,,

Furthermore, any excess enthalpy generation is then attributed to the reduction of electrogenerated oxygen although such assertions have not been accompanied by appropriate measurements.

"A cavity in a solid, first of all, serves as a place of confinement for a Deuterium molecule. Two deuterons in the molecule are trapped together in close proximity. Thus, they may engage in 'Low Energy Nuclear Reaction' which requires longer time, unlike collision type of nuclear reaction. Secondly, the electric field in the cavity (to be shown below) superimposed on this deuteron-pair would lower the Coulomb barrier between them facilitating a 'Low Energy Fusion' reaction. Furthermore, neutron exchange reaction between two deuterons (in an analogous manner like the electron exchange that forms a Deuterium molecule) is like a 'Long Range' force (as compared to the range of nuclear force) that can pull two deuterons together. This range is longer than that of the pi-plus exchange nuclear force between a proton and a neutron, because neutrons are charge neutral. [1] Longer reaction time; [2] Lowered Coulomb Barrier; [3] Longer range are the necessary conditions for (d-d) 'Cold Fusion'.",,,,,,

"Many LENR systems have been reported to generate small amounts of 4He from experiments that employ deuterium as part of the experiment. There are few analytical methods that can detect trace amounts of 4He in the presence of D2. Most commercial magnetic sector mass spectrometers are large and expensive and, while they have excellent ?m/m resolution, they still require some additional separation of He, such as a getter system to achieve ppb sensitivity. We have developed a lower cost, compact system that allows us to measure 4He down to sub ppm levels in D2 and other gasses. This system utilizes a column of activated carbon cooled with liquid nitrogen (LN2) that effectively absorbs everything but helium. Post absorption, the system uses an MKS Microvision residual gas analyzer (RGA) and a Stanford Research Systems (SRS) RS 100 RGA to check for helium purity. The helium eluted from the column is quantified by a small magnetic sector mass spectrometer tuned to mass 4. A typical sample size required to achieve ppb sensitivity to 4He is 50 cm3 at 50 Torr. Calibrations have been done with air, 4He in D2 at various concentrations and show a 3% variation from standard sample to standard sample. We will discuss the typical operation of this instrument and show results from various calibrations using different carrier gases.",,,,,,

"Low-energy nuclear reaction experiments using photographic emulsions, including those by Urutskoev, et.al, Ivoilov, and others have shown unique particle tracks. Analysis of a sample population of these types of tracks suggests detection of magnetically charged particles with faster-than-light velocities. Particle kinetic energy was estimated from energy deposition and momentum was estimated from track curvature in magnetic fields. Measured values were plotted on a kinetic energy versus momentum graph and were found to fall in the v > c region. Track curvature was found to be parabolic, which is a signature for monopoles. Using the classical theory of tachyons, the plane of parabolic curvature suggests electrically charged tachyons detected as slower-than-light monopoles. Preliminary lower limits for particle mass are found. Further study is suggested to broaden this search.",,,,,,

"In the literature of Low-Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR), particle tracks in photographic emulsions (and other materials) associated with certain electrical discharges have been reported. Some Russian and French researchers have considered these particles to be magnetic monopoles. The mechanisms of energy deposition and track formation, while among the most important properties, are contradictory and the least understood of all of the observations. Our method of producing these tracks differs markedly from most other studies in that no electrical discharge is used as a source. Rather, tracks are created with a simple uniform exposure to photons. This simpler method of producing exactly the same tracks supports a more comprehensive exploration of particle track properties. Out of 750 exposures with this method, elliptic particle tracks were detected, 22 of which were compared to Bohr–Sommerfeld electron orbits in an idealized model. Ellipses fitted to the tracks were found to have quantized semi-major axis sizes with ratios of ? n2/a2 to corresponding Bohr–Sommerfeld hydrogen ellipses. This prompts inquiry relevant to magnetic monopoles due to the n2/a2 force difference between magnetic charge and electric charge using the Schwinger quantization condition. Analogy with the electron indicates that the elliptic tracks could be created by a bound magnetically charged particle with mass mm = 1.45 × 10^-3 eV/c2, yet with superluminal velocities. Using a modified extended relativity model, mm becomes the relativistic mass of a superluminal electron, with m0 = 5.11 × 10^5 eV/c2, the fine structure constant becomes a mass ratio and charge quantization is the result of two states of the electron. Relevance of this new model is considered in light of the observed inconsistencies in track formation.",,,,,,

"Since 1989 the announcement of ""cold fusion"" by Stanley Pons and Martin Fleishmann, ""cold fusion"" field has been surrounded by controversy. After three decades, this field is alive and has produced thousands of publications, most in dedicated periodic and conferences. This work aims at checking whether ""cold fusion"" fits in pathological science traits. For each type of experiment and year, this work counted the distinct research groups results (success or failure). Experimental results from many research groups suggest that nuclear reactions in solids are more complex than fusion (it is not only fusion) and that they need energy triggers like background radiation, meaning chemical configurations alone do not seem to generate nuclear reactions. Some types of experiments present rising trends (the field does not fit in pathological science model) and have potential to bring disruptive technologies. If confirmed, experimental results will require revisions of accepted nuclear models.",,,,,,

"A summarized analysis of the influence that different concentrations of impurities in the crystal lattice can have on the phenomenon of catalyzed deuteron fusion. The numerical calculation carried out for Pd. Pt and Ni at fixed lattice-temperatures, varying the level of impurity between 0.28% and 0.72%, shows that increasing the level of the impurity increases the probability of penetrating the Coulomb barrier. This result can be interpreted by considering the trend of the potential which describes the effective interaction between deuterons within a metal: in effect, it shows that the coupling between plasmons and deuterons, in the presence of impurities, is able not only to reduce the thickness of the Coulomb barrier but also to lower its height K in various types of deuterated lattices.",,,,,,

In this work, we analyze the deuteron-deuteron reactions within palladium lattice by means of the coherence theory of nuclear and condensed matter [5] and, using this general theoretical framework accepted from ‘cold fusion scientists’, we will show the low occurrence probability of fusion phenomena. In fact, in the coherence approach, the D-D potential exhibits double barrier features and, in this way, the D-D fusion is inhibited.",,,,,,

"We have analysed the possibility that the coefficient of lattice deformation, linked to the formation of microcracks at room temperature and low energies, could influence the process of fusion. The calculated probability of fusion within a microcrack, in the presence of D2 loading at room temperature and for impure metals, shows moderately elevated values compared with the probability of fusion on the surface. For all the temperatures in the 150-350 K range and for all the energies between 150 and 250 eV, the formation of microcracks increases the probability of fusion compared to non-deformed lattices, and also reduces the thickness of the Coulomb barrier. Using the trend of the curve of potential to evaluate the influence of the concentration of impurities, a very high barrier is found within the pure lattice (J ˜ 0.25%). However, under the same thermodynamic conditions, the probability of fusion in the impure metal (J ˜ 0.75%) could be higher, with a total energy less than the potential so that the tunneling effect is amplified. Finally, we analysed the influence of forced D2 loading on the process.",,,,,,

In this work we seek to analyse the deuteron-deuteron reactions within palladium lattice by means of Preparata’s model of the palladium lattice [5,15]. We will also show the occurrence probability of fusion phenomena according to more accurate experiments [6]. We are not going to use any of the research models which have been previously followed in this field. Our aim is to demonstrate the theoretical possibility of cold fusion. Moreover, we will focus on tunneling the existent Coulomb barrier between two deuterons. Analysing the possible contributions of the lattice to the improvement of the tunneling probability, we find that there is a real mechanism through which this probability could be increased: this mechanism is the screening effect due to d-shell electrons of palladium lattice.

These phenomena open the way to the theoretical hypothesis that a kind of chain reaction, catalysed by the micro-cracks produced in the structure as a result of deuterium loading, can favour the process.",,,,,,

Further, in this paper, we have taken the interaction between deuteron-optical photons, we want to clarify this point, of course, these photons have a vibrational frequency of interest because it was discovered that the interaction between photons and deuterons causes the Coulomb barrier is not static, that has of oscillations in different directions within the lattice. So we can conclude that this phenomenon of cold fusion that breaks new ground in modern nuclear physics. In recent years, over 20 years, have seen thousands of experiments and theoretical models to explain the phenomenon of fusion at low energy (LENR) in specialized heavy hydrogen systems. We can say that a new possible way to obtain nuclear energy without waste is emerging. Nevertheless in spite of experimental contributions, the theoretical framework is not known. In this work, we try to explain the deuteron-deuteron reactions within palladium lattice by means of the coherence theory of nuclear and condensed matter. The coherence model of condensed matter affirms that within a deuteron-loaded palladium lattice there are three different plasmas: electrons, ions and deuterons plasma. Then, according to the loading percentage x = D/Pd, the ions deuterium can take place on the octahedrical sites or in the tetrahedral in the (1,0,0)-plane. In the coherence theory it is called ß-plasma the deuterons plasma in the octahedral site and ? -plasma which in tetrahedral. We propose a general model of effective local time-dependent deuteron-deuteron potential, that takes into account the electrons and ions plasma oscillations. The main features of this potential are extracted by means of many-body theory considering the interaction deuteron-phonon-deuteron. In fact the phonon exchange produces a attractive component between two deuteron within the D2 molecular. This attractive force is able to reduce the inter-nuclear distance from about 0.7 to 0.16 Å. It means that the lattice strongly modifies the nuclear environment with respect to free space. In this way according to deuterons energy, loading percentage and plasma frequency we are able to predict high o low tunneling probability. The fusion rates (s-1) computed vary from 10^-70 to 10^-17 and also a set of other mechanism, which could be enhanced these values, are proposed. In this way we hope that by means of this approach in the future will be possible to realize and control the nuclear exothermic reactions that take place in the condensed matter in order to obtain clean energy.",,,,,,

Charge and discharge of deuterons to the Pd plate was repeated cyclically by electrolysis. Highly significant difference of 1% level in statistics was observed between filled and emptied states in one sample among the four samples tested.

Therefore, two experiments being carried out by two cells at the same time were compared at any time and false signals in coincidence for two cells were able to be rejected as accidental noises.

"The resistance method was used in situ to determine the D/Pd ratio in the cathode of Pd|D2O+D2SO4 electrolytic-calorimetric systems. Thirty-three experimental runs with excess heat production indicated that there is no clear correlation between the excess power and the D/Pd ratio. Most excess heat occurs when the ratio is 0.5 < D/Pd < 0.7. Three different cathode pretreatments were tested. It is found that the excess heat reproducibility rate is 2/11 (18%), 21/32 (66%) and 25/50 (50%), and maximum excess power of 45 +/1 18 mW, 117 +/- 24 mW and 128 +/- 19 mW were achieved for samples etched in aqua regia, heated in D2SO4 and open electrolyzed in D2SO4, respectively, based on 93 runs of calorimetry with 25 Pd plates. This indicates that heating and open electrolyzing in D2SO4 are effective methods of pretreatment for excess heat production in subsequent electrolysis. Surface characterizations with 3D non-contact optical profiling, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) were performed for Pd samples of cold rolled, pretreated and electrolyzed. The results showed that the surface roughness of palladium increases prominently after pretreatment. New element silver was detected on Pd surface after electrolysis.",,,,,,

"It has now been established that during electrolysis of LiOD using Pd cathodes a threshold loading ratio of at least 0.85 needs to be achieved before excess heat production can be expected, However for emission of neutrons and tritium and possibly charged particles and transmutation products too much lower D/Pd ratios, in the region of 0.4 to 0.7 appears to be adequate. This has been independently corroborated in a variety of electrolytic and gas loading experiments. It is not so much the magnitudes of the steady state loading ratio, but rather creation of non-equilibrium conditions which facilitates rapid migration/transport of deuterons within the Pd lattice that seems to be required. With this in view a systematic study has been undertaken using electrically self-heated 0.1 25 mm dia Pd wires in H2/D2 atmospheres to optimize the conditions under wh ich rap id load ing/unloading or H2 or D2 can be achieved. Pd wire was of 99.9% purity and was procured from Lieco Industries USA.",,,,,,

"Having received, at short notice, the invitation to attend the second international conference on cold fusion as a sceptical observer, I began to study some of the papers which have appeared since the fall of 1989 after which I had stopped following the publications in this area. Being sceptical from the beginning, the many negative reports from renowned laboratories seemed to confirm that the disputed claims of cold fusion occurring in a solid were, unfortunately, based on the erroneous interpretation of ill-defined experiments. I now realize that in the meantime many new positive results have been published which can not be pushed aside quite so easily. Two reviews, currently in the course of publication, were very helpful and yielded much information on the present situation. These are the reviews of M. Srinivasan and E. Storms. Together with my reading and the lectures given on the first days of the conference, I eventually felt able to present my impressions in a lecture on the last day of the conference, as the organizers had requested. I am aware that all the arguments pro and contra the reality of cold fusion have been pointed out by others before. The first part of my contribution to the report of this conference is therefore mainly a reminder of the problems. In the second part I raise some questions seen with the eyes of a physical chemist being specially experienced in electrochemistry.",,,,,,

"Anomalous heat was measured from a reaction of atomic hydrogen in contact with potassium carbonate on a nickel surface. The nickel surface consisted of 500 feet of 0.0625 inch diameter tubing wrapped in a coil. The coil was inserted into a pressure vessel containing a light water solution of potassium carbonate. The tubing and solution were heated to a steady state temperature of 249°C using an FR heater. Hydrogen at 1100 psig was applied to the inside of the tubing. After the application of hydrogen, a 32°C increase in temperature of the cell was measured which corresponds to 25 watts of heat. Heat production under these conditions is predicted by the theory of Mills where a new species of hydrogen is produced that has a lower energy state then normal hydrogen. ESCA analyses, done independently by Lehigh University, have found the predicted 55 eV signature of this new species of hydrogen. Work is continuing at Thermacore with internal funding to bring this technology to the marketplace.",,,,,,

"A growing body of experimental evidence in this last decade has shown that some types of low-energy-induced nuclear reactions are possible. Key cathode characteristics considered important for these non-Joule heating reactions, as documented in a US patent application, are discussed. These concepts are incorporated into an electrolytic reactor system to encourage these reactions while discourage Joule heating of the electrolyte. However, even the more efficient reactor designs appear to have diminishing returns upon scale up. The MultiCell unit’s unique design allows for repetitive replication of the unit (much like a component on a circuit board or computer chip) to acquire the desired power output while still maintaining the efficiency of the small MultiCell unit. The design uses a plurality of small cells arranged in an interconnected array, wherein each cell is characterized by having a relatively small cathode separated from a relatively large anode by a small gap.",,,,,,

"Lack of reproducibility was a kind of original sin and a rich source of troubles, despair and skeptics from the start of the cold fusion story. Now the situation is much improved, but the progress has resulted mainly from trial and error experiments and not from cause-effect considerations, principles, models or theories. This statement is valid even for the newly born light-water excess energy experiments [1]. The most developed theories, e.g. the T.R.M. model of Bush [2] must be combined with purely empirical descriptions of know-how and engineering data as those of Cravens [3] for electrochemical cells. Scaramuzzi [4] for gas-metal systems, Mills [5] (the experimental part) and Mallove [1] for light water experiments. An example of spectacular irreproducibility was obtained by the scientists of the Bhabha Atomic Research Center [6,7]: ""not only are the anomalous fusion reactions found to take place in only a very few chips (obtained from the same piece of titanium) but even in those chips, tritium production is restricted to a small number of selected localized ‘hot spots' only...""",,,,,,

The current assumption of Deuterium Deuterium (DD) fusion based on the excellent work of Dr. Michael McKubre showing a near perfect match of excess heat to helium produced is only a correlation. The assumption of DD fusion may be fallacious and leading to a dead end. In many cases the Pons Fleischmann reaction starts with deuterium and ends with helium.

"We have modeled the behavior of hydrogen atoms in the flow of free electrons in metals by the molecular dynamic method. The trajectories of the particles were calculated by numerically solving a system of differential equations of mechanics. Relativistic equations were used, and the interaction of particles was considered Coulombic without taking into account magnetic effects. About 104 stories were modeled, each of them containing up to 100 collisions of free electrons with a hydrogen atom. The total number of simulated atoms that experienced collisions was ~ 10^6. Dynamic modeling revealed the formation of neutral particles consisting of protons (deuterons) with an electron rotating around them in nonstationary, close to elliptical orbits with an apogee to a distance of less than 10^-11 cm and to a perigee of ~ 10^-12 cm. These particles, which are continuously changing in size and shape, are up to 3 to 4 orders of magnitude smaller than ordinary hydrogen atoms, and 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than neutrons. Such nonstationary hydrogen miniatoms can exist for a short time (on our estimate, up to ~ 10^-12 sec.) in the environment of free electrons of metals, easily move in them and, like neutrons, approach the nuclei of isotopes of hydrogen or other elements at a distance at which nuclear fusion reactions or transmutation of elements are possible due to the tunneling effect. Taking into account the formation of such hydrogen miniatoms the previously calculated rate of low-energy nuclear reactions in metals1^-6 increases more than by 5 – 6 orders of magnitude, that is, to values corresponding to experimental data. Formation of hydrogen miniatoms in the medium of free electrons is of primary importance in the mechanism of low-energy nuclear reactions.",,,,,,

"Multiple implementations of a Lattice Energy Converter (LEC) have demonstrated the ability to self-initiate and self-sustain the production of a voltage and current over extended periods of time. A LEC converts the internal energy within the lattice of some materials, such as palladium, or of gases occluded within the lattice, such as hydrogen or deuterium, into ionizing radiation and electrical energy. Experiments include tests where the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the LEC were measured when an external voltage/current was applied, as well as other I-V tests where the spontaneous LEC voltage was measured as a function of temperature and resistance. LEC voltage and current has been shown to increasewith increased temperature. The electrical power produced by a LEC is similar to that produced by a nuclear battery however, a LEC does not require radioactive materials. While the energy levels produced to date are several orders of magnitude below those required formost power sources, the calculated flux of ionizing radiation necessary to produce the experimentally measured voltage and currentwould require the equivalent of several curies of radiation. These results have been independently replicated by two individuals. A video of the Lattice Energy Converter presentation, from the 2021 LENR workshop in honor of Dr. Srinivasan, is available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4dzTWY_aWM This paper expands on the YouTube video presentation with additional analysis that supports the observed experimental results.",,,,,,

Replicated experimental results and analysis for a LEC wherein a codeposited palladium-hydrogen working electrode produced spontaneous and sustained electrical energy attributed to ionizing radiation have been previously reported. Herein is reported the use of a working electrode comprised of codeposited iron-hydrogen from an aqueous solution of FeCl2 which demonstrated similar capabilities to produce spontaneous and sustained electrical energy as well as ionizing radiation. These results also have been replicated. http://ikkem.com/iccf23/PPT/Invited%20Gordon%20ICCF%2023%20LEC%20T5.MP4.

"A new ten-electrochemical cell experiment has been carried out in order to confinn the previous results and try to understand the key role of some experimental parameters in triggering the cold fusion events. The experiment was designed to detect: a) excess heat; b) loading factor by in situ measurement of the cathode displacement; c) nuclear products: neutrons, tritium in the electrolytic solution and in the recombined heavy water, gamma-ray; d) effect of the palladium electrode preparation. To measure the excess heat, a calibration curve of the input power vs temperature of the LiOD + D2O solution was obtained for cells equal in shape, materials and operating in the same experimental condition in which the experiment was actually performed. The unique difference was on the cathode. The cathode used in the calibration measurements was made of palladium rod gold-plated by electrochemical deposition. Neutron detector is a 3He proportional counter, the same used in the previous experiments, but the data acquisition is now Implemented by a fast pulse-shape storage and off-line discrimination for a very accurate counting. The findings of the experiment, lasted about 50 days, are: i) dependent on the type of the cathode, specific excess power values up to 96 W/cm3 was found; ii) specific excess power showed linear dependence from the current density with a threshold at around 150 mA/cm2; iii) the cathode swelling was dependent from the type of the cathode and in the case of rods it increased with the current density; iv) no evidence of nuclear products statistically significant was detected.",,,,,,

"Abstract The energy balance between heat excess and 4He in the gas phase has been found to be reasonably satisfied even if the low levels of 4He do not give the necessary confidence to state definitely that we are dealing with the fusion of deuterons to give 4He. In the melted cathode, the data of which are reported, no 4He was found at the achieved sensitivity. X-ray film, positioned at 50 mm from the cell, roughly gave the image of the cathode through spots. Extended considerations have been made to explain this evidence on the basis of the bundle nature of the cathode. From these considerations, the energy of the radiation and the total energy associated to it have been estimated as 89 keV and 12 kJ, respectively. This value is :0.5% of the energy measured by calorimetry in the same interval of time. The highest values of energy and excess power are 8.3 MJ and 10 W, respectively.",,,,,,

"The MHI claim to transmute elements upon permeation of deuterium though a specific multilayer structure was carefully evaluated. Initially, an attempt was made to replicate the work at NRL in collaboration with MHI. When replication proved difficult, another set of experiments were conducted at MHI in three sets consisting of two control blanks and one positive foil (that should have transmuted Cesium to Praseodymium) per set. Foil samples were split for analysis at both NRL and MHI. Extensive analytical work was performed to characterize the foils and the blanks. When extracted at MHI, low nanogram amounts of Pr were found by ICP-MS on 3 of 3 foils that should have had Pr whereas the 6 controls were blank. Split solutions of these extracts were also tested independently at NRL and the presence of Pr was confirmed. The Pr found did not have the characteristic rare earth contamination expected if the Pr was from the environment and thus looked like it was produced in the experiment. Unfortunately, we could not find Pr at NRL (even at trace levels) on our split foil samples no matter what extraction method was employed. After considering and evaluating several unlikely scenarios for these disparate results, we visited MHI and participated in the extraction process on new foils. These extracts were blank when tested at both laboratories. Environmental samples were obtained at various locations where samples were handled. Pr was found in large amounts at one location used in sample preparation and this Pr had the signature of pure material rather than an inadvertent contaminate. No record of how it got there could be established. Other rare and characteristic impurities also were found in the extracts from MHI that were present in the laboratory environment. Thus, we concluded that the transmutation of Cs to Pr when deuterium permeated MHI’s multilayer structure could not be firmly established, as contamination during the foil production or during the foil analysis could not be ruled-out. The design of the replication experiments, the lessons learned, and the results will be discussed.",,,,,,

In the ensuing weeks tremendous fervor in the scientific and political arenas at first gradually and then rather suddenly gave way to disillusion, marginalization and even ridicule. By early 1990 most ""mainstream"" scientists became convinced that the phenomenon did not exist, and politicians and the public generally followed suit. Since then nearly everyone, including scientists and energy policymakers, have believed that cold fusion is a dead issue. . . .",,,,,,

The OSSc paradigm grew out of the open source software movement of the last 20 years, which has resulted in wide availability of free software (such as the Linux operating system) as an alternative to proprietary software products. In many respects, OSSc represents a return to the concept that scientific research results are a public good rather than a proprietary product -- an attitude clearly articulated in the 1940s by Robert Merton, the ""father"" of the sociology of science.",,,,,,

"Cold fusion (CF) is a possible phenomenon in which energy-producing nuclear reactions occur at earth-surface temperatures rather than at high temperatures that are characteristic of hot fusion, such as in the interior of the sun. CF was dramatically and unexpectedly announced at a press conference in 1989. For a variety of reasons, including the method of announcement and difficulties in experimental replication, CF was rejected by mainstream science within a year. Continued experimental success under highly marginalized conditions in the years since rejection indicates, with reasonable probability, that CF may eventually be found to be a real phenomenon. The scientific results accumulated in the years since rejection include over 300 verifications of CF-related phenomena.",,,,,,

"The potential benefits of LENR as a source of energy have been well understood since its announcement in 1989. The improved prospects of LENR in the past few years are indicated by the significant numbers and varied locations of researchers in several countries, a large body of accumulated evidence, major advances in explanation and theory development, and recent favourable occurrences, including a plethora of proposed energy-producing devices. The changing landscape creates policymaking opportunities for supporting LENR to realize its potential benefits, planning proactively to deal with anticipated adverse secondary impacts, and integrating the updates in a comprehensive policy program. The first policymaking opportunity, updates of current policies for LENR support, may best be accomplished in a framework of evidence-based policymaking. The level of evidence for the existence of LENR is at least a preponderance of evidence (greater than 50% probability). There may even be clear and convincing evidence (greater than 70%). Correspondingly, the policy response should be at least reinstatement and research comparable to other emerging energy technologies. Enhanced support, perhaps on a par with hot fusion, is indicated if there is clear and convincing evidence. The second policymaking opportunity related to LENR’s changing landscape is to address potential adverse secondary impacts with proactive planning. Broad deployment of LENR for energy supply may be expected to have major secondary impacts as a disruptive technology. Direct impacts will take place on all phases of the energy chain – supply, transport, storage, and consumption. Indirect impacts will be felt most by the components of society that are closely tied to the energy cycle, such as sectors of the workforce and energy-based communities. Technology assessment is a mature and readily available methodology for identifying secondary impacts and developing mitigative measures. A third policymaking opportunity is to integrate LENR policy updates that are needed as demonstrated by its changing landscape. Policies for mitigating adverse secondary impacts, for example, can be formulated based on policies for LENR support and the resulting pace of its development and deployment. New and updated policies may also be integrated at the national and international level and between the public and private sectors. The public interest will be served by update and integration of LENR policies for its development and mitigating its impacts. However, many challenges must be overcome to achieve the update and integration objectives. The world desperately needs new sources of clean and inexpensive energy. The case of cold fusion would perhaps be a curiosity in the history of science if the stakes were not so high.",,,,,,

Many agencies of the U.S. Government have energy policy responsibilities. These responsibilities include both development and realization of emerging energy technologies and dealing with their secondary impacts. A paper has been prepared to describe the potential role that cold fusion may play in helping agencies accomplish their missions in realizing the benefits of new energy sources and mitigating their secondary impacts.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"This White Paper serves as an underpinning of the above paper by identifying the most significant energy policymaking agencies of the U.S. Government, describing their overall missions and responsibilities, and delineating their interests specifically in emerging energy technologies. The stage is then set for assessing the potential role of cold fusion. A rigorous attempt is made to characterize the energy interests of the agencies ""in their own words"" by extensive review of publicly-available information (primarily websites) made available by the agencies themselves.",,,,,,

"Cold fusion (low energy nuclear reaction, LENR) was rejected by mainstream science within a year or so of its announcement in 1989. Despite the rejection, LENR continued to be investigated by many researchers worldwide. The LENR Research Documentation Initiative (LRDI) is underway to mitigate the loss of records of investigators who began their work shortly after the announcement and are now leaving the field. The LRDI began with a pilot project with Edmund Storms and now includes 15 participants. Projects typically include publications, unpublished reports, electronic and hardcopy files, lab descriptions and notebooks, publications by others (LENR library), and photos, recordings and other media. The records found in an LRDI project are supplemented with one or more rounds of recorded and transcribed interviews. Where possible, timelines of LENR research are prepared. Each project is documented with memos for each component followed by a report of the investigator’s research contributions. Preservation of these records for additional review and analysis as progress is made in the field may contribute to the realization of LENR and its energy benefits. The long-term prospects of humankind will be improved greatly with new sources of abundant, inexpensive and clean energy like LENR.",,,,,,

"Cold fusion (now widely referred to as low energy nuclear reactions, LENR) has many potential energy benefits for society, but it also has risks of major disruption. Despite being rejected soon after its announcement 30 years ago, LENR has continued to be pursued by researchers worldwide. The continued vitality of the field, and substantial progress in understanding and reproducibility of the phenomenon, have challenged the initial verdict on LENR as non-legitimate science. LENR realization for the benefit of society will be enhanced by the forces of the free market. But government policy changes are needed to realize LENR benefits and deal with its anticipated disruptive impacts. Evidence-based policy making is a rational way to revisit negative policies for research support. Technology assessment is a candidate method for identifying and mitigating LENR’s adverse secondary effects. Government agencies and the private sector have the opportunity with LENR to accomplish their missions. As a potential new source of abundant, low-cost, and clean energy, LENR has the possibility of substantially improving the long-term prospects of humankind.",,,,,,

"Cold fusion originated at the University of Utah, when Fleischmann and Pons announced it at a press conference on March 23, 1989. A project is being performed to document the cold fusion files that are still available at the University. It is being undertaken in the LENR Research Documentation Initiative (LRDI), whose overall objective is to capture cold fusion research records while they are still available. The LRDI is a program at the firm LENRGY, LLC.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"The project began with careful review of the website of the University’s Marriott Library, along with download of relevant materials. A trip was made in August 2021 to review the University holdings. Substantial cold fusion records were found for several organizations and individuals. They comprise more than 530 boxes of materials. Records of the work of Fleischmann and Pons, such as lab notebooks or other information on experiments, were not found for this project.",,,,,,

"Dr. Mahadeva Srinivasan was one of the earliest and most productive researchers in the LENR field. He took an immediate interest in the phenomenon and began research within a day or two after the March 23, 1989 announcement – at a time when he already had more than 30 years of nuclear research experience at India’s Bhabba Atomic Research Center (BARC). He conducted many LENR investigations using several methods, with emphasis on neutron emission and tritium generation as signatures of the effect.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"After he retired from BARC in 1997, he became very active in the field after a 10-year ""silent period"". Hismain emphasis after 2008 was on promoting LENR research in India. Because of his stature in the nuclear field in India, Dr. Srinivasan was able through his connections and friendships to arrange for LENR research programs and funding at several organizations. He chaired the 16th International Conference on Cold Fusion (ICCF-16) in Chennai in 2011. . . .",,,,,,

"An initiative is underway to document the records of cold fusion researchers while the information is still available. Now more than 30 years after the 1989 LENR announcement, many of these investigators are leaving the field. Projects under the LENR Research Documentation Initiative (LRDI) generally begin with a site visit where information is collected and interviews are conducted. Provision is made for securing the records, and a project report is prepared. More than 20 projects including over 25 participants and collaborators have been performed or are underway. The LRDI includes a major outreach effort to ensure participation and promote the overall standing of cold fusion. Future plans for the initiative call for additional participants and more in-depth coverage of research documented in previous projects. An integrated LRDI report including summaries of the individual projects is being prepared. Documentation of the large body of LENR research is essential both for the field and for humankind generally. Capturing the records enhances the prospects of the field by demonstrating the large amount of the information and the credibility of the researchers. The future of humanity depends on developing an inexhaustible supply of clean and inexpensive energy. LENR is one of the best candidates currently available to meet this need.",,,,,,

No significant excess heat events were observed in 231 laser triggered trials across 9 cathode runs. The average excess heat rate observed from all runs was 6.1  21.6 mW with 10 W of input electrical power. We found no evidence of excess heat on the order of 100 mW reported by Letts. Calorimetry artifacts stemming from apparatus design issues often exceeded 100 mW and contributed to larger-than-desired uncertainties on individual excess heat measurements.",,,,,,

Several different methods of introducing calibration power to the calorimeter were studied and the calibration constant was found to be independent of the method. Calibration constants could be determined with a precision to + 0.5 %. Furthermore, they were independent of the input power level up to 22 W and with a cell temperature up to 60 0C over appreciable periods of time. This new design possesses many advantages that makes it suitable for careful studies of the thermal behavior of electrochemical systems, such as the electrochemical insertion of deuterium into Pd cathodes.",,,,,,

Metallurgical examination of some of the electrodes showed extensive damage associated with deuterium loading. Surfaces have been found to be covered with large number of impurities. Initiation and sustaining these heat bursts, monitoring of nuclear products and materials aspects of these electrolytic cells have been the focus of our current efforts. As D/Pd loading appear to be critical, the measurement of deuterium loading using dilatometry as a function of current density, surface and heat treatment of the cathode and poisoning are currently being investigated.",,,,,,

"Nuclear reactions which may exhibit coherent effects have been studied as a candidate explanation for cold fusion effects. An analysis of a general class of two-step coherent reactions involving charged nucleons has been performed, and very small reaction rates are found. This result is due to the small tunneling factors associated with coulomb repulsion.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"We are investigating two-step coherent reactions which begin through weak interaction mediated electron capture, which in hydrogen isotopes would produce off-shell (virtual) neutrons. No coulomb repulsion occurs for virtual neutrons. Virtual neutron capture by deuterons would yield tritium, and virtual neutron capture by protons would yield deuterons; the latter process is favored by a factor of 104 in the square of the matrix element on a per nucleon basis, and corresponds to a heat-producing reaction. The nuclear reaction energy would be coupled into the electrolysis process, with the final reaction products stationary.",,,,,,

We propose a new set of second order reactions in which a local exothermic reaction couples off-resonance to a highly excited phonon mode at low order, and the phonon mode dissipates the large energy quantum through low order coupling to endothermic channels.",,,,,,

"Nuclear reactions in a lattice are described using an extension of the resonating group method to include the lattice explicitly. Phonon exchange during fusion and dissociation reactions is predicted Second-order site-other-site reactions are predicted under conditions where the reactions at each site exchange phonons with a common phonon mode. The null reaction in which a dd-fusion at one site is coupled to 4He dissociation at another site is modeled. Coupled-channel equations are developed for the two-site problem, as an illustration of the application of the lattice resonating group method. We have proposed previously that there should exist compact state solutions of the coupled-channel equations, as the associated exchange potential can be attractive. Such states have been proposed to account for the Kasagi effect, and to provide a foundation for many of the anomalies that are seen in metal deuterides. Our analysis of the two-site system suggests so far has not yielded compact state solutions. Preliminary results for the many-site problem are presented, which leads to evidence in support of the stability of the compact states, and which leads to a new overall picture for the anomalies.",,,,,,

"We present a systematic, but abbreviated, account of issues and models for anomalies in metal deuterides. To interact, deuterons must get close to one another, and we consider conditions under which this occurs and the ramiﬁcations. Within the general picture under discussion, anomalies are ultimately a consequence of phonon exchange that occurs when nuclear reactions take place in the solid state. We review the generalization of the resonating group method for reactions in vacuum to include solid state effects, and discuss implications for experiment. Phonon exchange in the case of a much simpliﬁed scalar Gaussian nuclear model is reviewed. The coupling of reactions at different sites is explored, and connections are made with recent experiments on alpha emission. The fastest site-other-site reactions are null reactions in which fusion reactions and their inverses are coupled. A consideration of these processes leads to the conclusion that compact states should be present stabilized by phonon exchange, and that these may be responsible for anomalies in recent beam experiments with metal deuterides. Energy exchange between nuclei and the lattice can be very efficient, according to results from idealized models for null reactions involving many sites. Aspects of excess heat production and other effects appear to be addressed by the new models.",,,,,,

"Issues involved in the tunneling of deuterons in metal deuterides are considered in relation to experimental claims of anomalies in metal deuterides. From earlier studies, screening is thought to be similar to the case of molecular D2 . Resonant tunneling has been advocated in the literature as a possible mechanism to achieve tunneling enhancements. We develop a two-level system for a piecewise constant potential model for resonant tunneling that matches the energy levels in the vicinity of a level crossing, arguing that such models are applicable for more general potential models. Resonant tunneling effects and dynamics, including acceleration due to coherence, are accounted for in the model. The model is extended to include relaxation effects, and it is found that one would not expect to find coherent effects associated with tunneling in the case of two deuterons in a metal lattice. We present a simple model for the transfer of excitation from a collection of deuterons to a collection of helium nuclei, a model closely related to resonant tunneling and also to new phonon-coupled SU(N) models under development. The excitation transfer models show coherent enhancements as well as collective effects.",,,,,,

Practical thermal to electric conversion is possible well below the Carnot limit, and this leads to a high threshold for self-sustaining operation in Pons-Fleischmann type experiments. Excess power production at elevated temperatures will become increasingly important as we move toward self-sustaining devices and energy production for applications. Excess power production in heatproducing systems that do not require electrical input have an enormous advantage over electrochemical systems.

"Models based on phonon exchange for excess heat production in Fleischmann-Pons experiments are considered. In the case that sufficient phonon exchange occurs to stabilize intermediate states containing a neutral, then a model in which excitation is transferred from the D2 /4He system to a strongly coupled quantum system made up of an oscillator (highly-excited phonon mode) and a Dicke system (ground state and excited state receiver nuclei) seem appropriate. We find that a coupled Dicke system and oscillator can support energy coupling in the case of strong coupling. We present evolution equations for resonant coupled Dicke systems, augmented with loss.

At ICCF14 we presented a formula that can be used to calculate the phonon exchange matrix element for a nuclear reaction occurring in a lattice; in this presentation we report on our progress in the brute force computation of the matrix element based on realistic nuclear models. We consider also the development of semiclassical models which can approximate the dynamics of the quantum model. Finally, we describe the use of these models in a numerical simulation of the Fleischmann-Pons experiment. In these models a bottleneck occurs associated with helium diffusion out of the active region. We find that if the active region is thin (100 nm or less) that helium diffusion is fast, and excess heat production can occur in a steady state mode. If the active region is thick (500 nm or greater), then helium diffusion is slow and excess heat in these models occurs in bursts.",,,,,,

We have calculated yields for Kα X-rays as a function of the energetic alpha particle energy in PdD.

"In recent Fleischmann-Pons experiments carried out by different groups, a thermal signal is seen indicative of excess energy production of a magnitude much greater than can be accounted for by chemistry. Correlated with the excess heat appears to be 4He, with the associated energy near 24 MeV per helium atom. In nuclear reactions, the energy produced is expressed through the kinetic energy of the products; hence it would be natural to assume that some of the reaction energy ends up as kinetic energy of the 4He nucleus. Depending on the energy that the helium nucleus is born with, it will result in radiation (such as neutrons or x-rays) that can be seen outside of the cell. We have computed estimates of the expected neutron and x-ray emission as a function of helium energy, and compared the results with upper limits taken from experiments. Experimental results with upper limits of neutron emission between 0.008 to 0.8 n/J are found to correspond to upper limits in alpha energy between 6.2 keV and 20.2 keV.",,,,,,

"Excess heat in the Fleischmann-Pons experiment is observed without commensurate energetic particles, which is inconsistent with known nuclear reactions. Any proposed model must address this at the outset. At present, we recognize are two general approaches to the problem: mechanisms which transfer the reaction energy directly to a condensed matter mode, which requires the fractionation of a large quantum into many small quanta; mechanisms in which the large energy quantum is converted to kinetic energy over a very large number of neighboring nuclei. We have focused on the first approach, and we have found a model that seems to accomplish this. Here we introduce the model, which we call the ""lossy spin-boson model"". We find that energy exchange in the lossless spin-boson model is hindered due to destructive interference effects. Augmenting the model with loss removes the destructive interference, and we use perturbation theory on a specific example for illustration. Feshbach projection operators and the Brillouin-Wigner formalism which we adopt to describe loss in the model are reviewed in Appendix A.",,,,,,

This has motivated us to consider models in which the excess energy is communicated directly to low energy degrees of freedom associated with the solid state environment. We have found relatively simple models which are capable of splitting up a large energy quantum into a very large number of much smaller energy quanta. In order to analyze these new models, we are motivated to consider the dynamics associated with a set of ordered degenerate states with nearest neighbor coupling.",,,,,,

"In the Fleischmann-Pons experiment, energy is produced without commensurate energetic reaction products. To account for this we have proposed new models in which coherent energy exchange occurs between two-level systems with a large energy quantum, and an oscillator with a much smaller characteristic energy. In earlier work we demonstrated using perturbation theory that the lossy spin-boson model is capable of efficient coherent energy exchange when many oscillator quanta are exchanged for a two-level system quanta on resonance. Here we introduce a formulation that isolates nearly degenerate states in the lossy spin-boson model, and allows the computation of the self-energy and indirect coupling matrix elements. From calculations of simple lossy spin boson models we establish a scaling law and define the dimensionless coupling constant g for the system. Direct calculations using this approach is not possible for large models in which a great many oscillator quanta are exchanged, but the formulation provides a foundation for understanding this kind of model, and will allow us to develop more powerful approximate methods.",,,,,,

"We are interested in the problem of coherent energy exchange in the spin-boson model augmented with loss, in the limit of infinite loss. This model is interesting because it predicts rapid coherent energy exchange under conditions when the transition energy of the two-level systems is much greater than the characteristic energy of the oscillator. Here we introduce the local approximation, in which we assume that the matrix elements change little when an energy exchange event occurs. This approximation results in a periodic system when a resonance condition is satisfied, which is much easier to solve than the original problem. We consider a model problem where we analyze the self-energy and indirect coupling matrix elements numerically and in the local approximation, with good agreement. Systematic results from the local approximation are obtained for the self-energy and indirect coupling matrix elements in models where 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 quanta are exchanged.",,,,,,

We focus on the lossy spin-boson model since it is capable of efficient energy exchange between two-level systems and an oscillator under conditions where the characteristic energy of the oscillator is small compared to the transition energy of the two-level systems. We are considering this model as the essential component for a theoretical understanding of the excess heat effect in the Fleischmann-Pons experiment. We introduce an iterative algorithm that allows the numerical calculation of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the coefficient eigenvalue equation that arises in the local approximation. From systematic calculations in the strong coupling limit we establish scaling laws for the self-energy and for the indirect coupling matrix element in the local approximation.

"Energy in the Fleischmann-Pons experiment is produced without commensurate energetic particles, and 4He is seen in amounts proportional to the energy produced (with a ratio of energy to number near 24 MeV). Correspondingly we focus on the D2/ 4He transition as a two-level system coupled to an oscillator, in order to make a connection with the lossy spin-boson model considered in previous work. Because of the strong Coulomb repulsion between the deuterons, the associated coupling matrix element is very small, and there is no possibility of converting the transition energy to oscillator quanta within a simple lossy spin-boson model. This motivates us to generalize to more complicated model that includes a set of (donor) two-level systems for the D2/ 4He transition, and a set of (receiver) two-level systems that are strongly coupled to the oscillator. We analyze the resulting model in the limit that the receiver system is very strongly coupled. Within this formulation, the associated dynamics can be interpreted in terms of a transition from D2 to 4He with direct conversion (and fractionation) of the large energy quantum to the oscillator, once the coupling with the receiver system is sufficiently strong.",,,,,,

The excess heat effect is prodigious, and 4He seems to be correlated with the energy, but there are no energetic particles seen in amounts commensurate with the energy. This motivated us to seek models which fractionate a large energy quantum, and the lossy spin-boson model appears to do the job. Coherent energy exchange in the fractionation limit and excitation transfer are the mechanisms required which allow us to describe a new set of reactions and associated models which seem to be relevant to the experiments.

"Motivated by many observations of anomalies in condensed matter systems, we consider a new fundamental Hamiltonian in which condensed matter and nuclear systems are described initially on the same footing. Since it may be possible that the lattice will respond to the mass change associated with a excited nuclear state, we adopt a relativistic description throughout based on a many-particle Dirac formalism. This approach has not been used in the past, perhaps due to the difficulty in separating the center of mass and relative degrees of freedom of the nuclear system, or perhaps due to an absence of applications for such a model. In response to some recent ideas about how to think about the center of mass and relative separation, we obtained from the Dirac model a new fundamental Hamiltonian in which the lattice couples to different states within the composite nuclei within the lattice. In this description the different nuclear states have different mass energies and kinetic energies, as we had expected. In addition there appear new terms which provide for nuclear excitation as a result of coupling to the composite momentum. This new effect comes about because of changes in the composite nuclear state as a result of the dynamical Lorentz boost in the lattice.",,,,,,

"The lossy spin-boson model is of interest to us since it predicts efficient energy exchange between identical two-level systems and an oscillator when the transition energy is a large (odd) multiple of the the oscillator energy. This model is not so easy to solve directly in the strong coupling regime, so we have developed approximate versions of the model that are easier to analyze. Here we introduce the pulse and amplitude approximation which compares very well with exact numerical solutions when the coupling is strong, and when the characteristic oscillator energy is much less than the transition energy. We examine discrete and continuum versions of the approximation, and find that they give good results for the solutions and for the self-energy. We show that the indirect coupling matrix element can be estimated from differences in the eigenvalue of the pulse optimization constraint for solutions with different phases.",,,,,,

Within this model there appears a term in which lattice vibrations are coupled to internal nuclear transitions. This is interesting as it has the potential to provide a connection between experiment and models that describe coherent energy transfer between two-level systems and an oscillator. In this work we describe a calculation of the coupling matrix element in the case of the deuteron based on the old empirical Hamada-Johnston model for the nucleon-nucleon interaction. The triplet S and D states of the the deuteron in the rest frame couples to a singlet P state through this new interaction.

"The biggest theoretical problem associated with excess heat in the Fleischmann-Pons experiment in our view has been the absence of energetic particles in amounts commensurate with the energy produced. In response we have pursued models in which the large nuclear energy quantum is fractionated into a great many lower energy quanta. To connect these idealized models to the physical system we need to evaluate the associated coupling matrix elements. Recently we have found a new coupling mechanism that arises when a lattice model is derived starting from a Dirac description of individual nucleons; this coupling mechanism can be considered a generalization of spin-orbit coupling and produces interactions between the center of mass dynamics and internal nuclear degrees of freedom. In this work we develop a simplified model for 4He and molecular D2 states with which we evaluate the phonon exchange matrix element for D2/4He transitions based on the new interaction. We restrict our calculation to the central and tensor contributions of the Hamada-Johnston nucleon-nucleon potential, which are the strongest, and find coupling between ground state 4He and triplet P and F molecular states. This interaction matrix element can be used in generalized lossy spin-boson models for the calculation of excess heat production in the Fleischmann-Pons experiment.",,,,,,

"In the Fleischmann-Pons experiment, excess heat is thought to have a nuclear origin due to the amount of energy produced, yet there are no commensurate energetic particles. This has motivated us over the years to focus attention on models in which a large quantum is fractionated into a great many small quanta. We have found that many two-level systems with a large transition energy are able to exchange energy coherently with an oscillator with a much smaller characteristic energy as long as decay channels are present in the vicinity of the two-level transition energy. In previous work we analyzed this basic model, and obtained estimates for the coherent energy exchange rate in the strong coupling limit. In this work we consider a version of this model where the upper states of the two-level systems are unstable. In this case, there is no coherent energy exchange, but instead we find a dynamical polarization effect which we have analyzed. We extend the model to the case of three-level systems, and generalize the result to apply to general N-level systems. Coherent energy exchange is possible within the context of a donor and receiver model, where the receiver transitions have unstable upper states. We give results for the donor dynamics in this case. This model provides a foundation for a new kind of model that we put forth recently for which the predictions appear to be closely connected to experiment.",,,,,,

"Widom and Larsen have put forth a model to describe excess heat and transmutation in LENR experiments. This model is the single most successful theoretical model that the ?eld has seen since it started; it has served as the theoretical justi?cation for a program at NASA; and it has accumulated an enormous number of supporters both within and outside of the condensed matter nuclear science community. The ?rst step in the model involves the proposed accumulation of mass by electrons through Coulomb interactions with electrons and ions in highly-excited coupled plasmon and optical phonon modes. Historically for us this mass increase has been hard to understand, so we were motivated in this study to understand better how this comes about. To study it, we consider simple classical models which show the effect, from which we see that the mass increase can be associated with the electron kinetic energy. The basic results of the simple classical model carry over to the quantum problem in the case of simple wave packet solutions. Since there are no quantum ?uctuations of the longitudinal ?eld in the Coulomb gauge, the resulting problem is conventional, and we ?nd no reason to expect MeV electron kinetic energy in a conventional consideration of electrons in metals. We consider the numerical example outlined in a primer on the Widom–Larsen model, and ?nd that multiple GW/cm2 would be required to support the level of vibrational excitation assumed in the surface layer; this very large power per unit area falls short by orders of magnitude the power level needed to make up the expected energy loss of the mass-enhanced electrons. We note that the mass enhancement of an electron in a transverse ?eld is connected to acceleration, so that the electron radiates. A similar effect is expected in the longitudinal case, and a very large amount of easily detected X-ray radiation would be expected if an MeV-level mass enhancement were present even in a modest number of electrons",,,,,,

"We have been interested in the development of a model for anomalies in condensed matter nuclear science, and over the past few years we have developed new models that describe coherent phonon exchange between a highly-excited vibrational mode and nuclei under conditions of fractionation. When we modeled collimated X-ray emission in the Karabut experiment, we found that the conditions required by the model did not match the conditions of the experiment. One possible reason for this might be the neglect of phonon ?uctuations due to coupling with conduction electrons. We would like to add a description of this effect to our phonon–nuclear model; however, models normally used for electron–phonon interactions in metals are based on the Bloch picture, and we were concerned that it may not be well suited to the problem. This has motivated us to develop a new model for phonon ?uctuations in a metal that is based on the Born–Oppenheimer picture, within the context of a Brillouin–Wigner formulation. The Born–Oppenheimer results are complicated, so we have reduced them in a simpler ?xed-point picture (which is based on a Taylor series expansion of the Born–Oppenheimer approximation around ?xed nuclear equilibrium points). In order to verify the resulting formalism, we constructed a simpli?ed model for the monatomic crystal phonon dispersion relation, which is well known in the Bloch picture literature. From this model we are able to extract the longitudinal dielectric constant. We ?nd that the ?xed-point dielectric constant at second order is more accurate than the Bloch picture equivalent, and that it includes dynamic corrections that match the result from ?eld theory up to O(?2). This model is used in a subsequent paper for the development of phonon ?uctuation models, where it is found that the Bloch picture is appropriate when the metal sample is micron scale or larger, and that the Born–Oppenheimer picture is appropriate for nano-scale samples.",,,,,,

"Excess heat in the Fleischmann–Pons experiment is thought to have a nuclear origin, yet there are no energetic particles observed in amounts commensurate with the energy produced. This in our view is the most fundamental issue in connection with theory. In earlier work we developed a mathematical model (the lossy spin–boson model) which shows coherent energy exchange between two-level systems and an oscillator under conditions of fractionation. Recently, we have found an interesting physical model that is closely connected, and which is capable of coherent energy exchange with fractionation; this model is based on a relativistic description of composite nuclei in a lattice. In this work we present a much stronger development of the model directly from ?eld theory than given previously. In the lossy spin–boson model, the ability of the model to fractionate a large quantum depends on the presence of suitable loss mechanisms; the same is true in the case of the new physical model. The new model predicts anomalies such as excess heat without energetic nuclear radiation, 4He production, low-level gamma emission, and collimated X-ray emission in the Karabut experiment; however, as yet we have not demonstrated agreement between theory and experiment. Last summer we concluded (erroneously) that coupling with strong static transitions might impact the fractionation power of the model on dynamic transitions, and the resulting model appeared to be in agreement with our interpretation of the experiment. Here we review this kind of model more carefully, and ?nd that no such enhancement is present. Our conclusion in the end is that the theory, model, and interpretation are ""close"" to the experimental results in the case of the Karabut experiment, but some problem remains.",,,,,,

"Excess heat in the Fleischmann–Pons experiment occurs without commensurate energetic nuclear radiation, which motivated us to seek mechanisms capable of fractionating a large quantum, resulting in the lossy spin-boson model. Collimated x-ray emission in the Karabut experiment we interpreted as demonstrating the conversion of vibrational energy to nuclear excitation, as predicted from the lossy spin-boson model; this motivated us to seek physical models that could account for the effect. We found that the coupling strength associated with electron–nuclear and electron–electron coupling was too weak to fractionate keV quanta into 100 MHz vibrations, which motivated us to seek a theory in which nuclear transitions coupled directly to vibrations. These considerations led us to a lattice model with a relativistic description of compound nuclei, in which a strong phonon-nuclear interaction is present. This interaction is normally rotated out with the Foldy–Wouthuysen transformation, but in the presence of strong loss mechanisms",,,,,,
"this transformation becomes unhelpful. The model that results describes the coupling of vibrational energy to nuclear excitation, but earlier efforts to apply it to the Karabut experiment resulted in inconsistencies. This motivated us to analyze fluctuations due to electron-phonon coupling in metals, which we find here to be a weak effect for Bloch picture phonon exchange, and a somewhat stronger effect with Born–Oppenheimer phonon exchange. As no new physics were found to substantially enhance fractionation, we returned to the basic theory, and carried out a systematic analysis of the three different degrees of freedom that result from simple product approximations for the wavefunction. We find that when there are more virtual phonons than real, a significant enhancement of the coupling strength occurs, corresponding to a new anomalous regime. Conditions on the coupling matrix element and relative state occupation are derived for the anomalous regime, which favors strongly-coupled low energy transitions which constitute a large",,,,,,
"fraction of all nuclei present. The fractionation power of a sample in the anomalous regime is very much constrained, which allows us to be able to make predictions with the new model. We find that the 30.77 keV transition in 93Nb is likely to be in the anomalous regime in a Nb cathode; that the threshold fractionation energy is too low for excitation of the 30.77 keV transition; but that the threshold fractionation energy is high enough to result in the excitation of the 1565 eV transition in 201Hg, and x-ray emission in the few keV regime consistent with Karabut’s observations.",,,,,,

"When Pd is in equilibrium with H2 or D2 in gas, the chemical potentials are equal, and this allows a determination of the chemical potential and other thermodynamic properties of palladium hydride and palladium deuteride. At high loading near room temperature, the gas pressure must be very high, and an ideal gas law no longer applies. In this case a knowledge of the fugacity is required to interpret and understand the results. We examine empirical models for the equation of state and fugacity of H2 which are relevant to the high pressure regime of interest, including an old model of Holley et al (1958), and the more modern models of Spycher and Reed (1988), Tkacz and Litwiniuk (2002), and Joubert (2010). At high pressure the more recent models are best, but the model of Tkacz and Litwiniuk diverges from the ideal gas equation of state at low pressure, which leads to an offset in the fugacity. We examine the difference between the equation of states for H2 and D2 in recent models, and find that the small difference at high pressure in the models of Tkacz and Litwiniuk agree best with experiment, while the larger difference in the models of Joubert (2010) and Joubert and Thiebaut (2011) is probably not reliable. We examine the possibility of developing a difference correction for the fugacity theoretically. It may be possible to account accurately for the zero-point contribution; however, accounting for",,,,,,

"The hydrogen evolution reaction model was proposed many years ago by the founders of modern electrochemistry. The closely related deuterium evolution reaction model describes deuterium loading in Pd cathodes in the Fleischmann–Pons experiment. We were interested in what issues were involved in the development of a high D/Pd loading, since over the years the importance of obtaining a high D/Pd ratio to obtain excess heat has been emphasized. In order to simplify things, we focus on the Volmer and Tafel reactions, and develop a steady state adsorption isotherm for the Vomer-Tafel regime. The adsorption isotherm is extended to become an absorption isotherm within a simplified picture that takes the surface sites to be equivalent to the bulk sites. While not a particularly good approximation, this allows us to model the D/Pd loading simply as a function of the overpotential, and hence the electrochemical current density. From a Tafel curve we can get some of the parameters for the Volmer current model, and from other eletrochemical data we can estimate the remaining Volmer and Tafel parameters. The resulting model fits the experimental data used well at low current density. Cathodes that load more highly with this approach require new models, potentially one for each cathode. We examine our earlier proposal that the differences in loading seen in experiment is due in part to large variations in the rate for internal D2 leaks. Consequently, we modify the Tafel reaction current model to account for internal leaks separately from the surface gas loss, and take advantage of data from the most highly loaded cathodes to estimate the surface Tafel reaction rate. Using this approach, the reference cathode that we used for our fits initially must have an internal leak rate more than two orders of magnitude higher than the rate of surface D2 loss. We conclude that minimizing the internal leaks is important in achieving high loading. Probably a key reason that there were so many negative results early in the field was because the cathode internal leak rate was very high in the cathodes used.",,,,,,

"High D/Pd loading is known to be a requirement for producing excess heat in the Fleischmann–Pons experiment, and much work has in recent years been focused on electrochemical protocols and cathode processing in order to achieve D/Pd loadings approaching unity routinely. However, we know very little about PdD at a loading near unity, and almost nothing about what happens when the loading exceeds unity. It may be that when the octahedral sites are fully occupied, additional interstitial deuterium atoms occupy tetrahedral sites, a proposal which at this point has little experimental support. It is nevertheless possible to construct an empirical model for this scenario, and to make use of available experimental data to fit the associated model parameters. We worked with empirical models for both PdD and PdH that assume an O-site energy quadratic in loading, and an O-site to T-site excitation which is either constant in loading, or else taken as an empirical function fit to estimates inferred from the analysis of experimental data. There are two empirical models, each with four or more free parameters; and insufficient experimental data from which to choose each parameter or function independently. We add supplementary constraints that presume the models for PdH and PdD must be very similar, which reduces the number of degrees of freedom within the models. This allows data from PdH to be used to construct a model for PdD, and vice versa. The models which result are interesting; they suggest these complicated systems might be understood based on a simple underlying picture; they indicate that there is more T-site occupation than has been appreciated previously in the literature; they indicate that the resistance ratio calibrations for PdH and PdD are inconsistent; and finally, measurements of the chemical potential at high loading have the potential to provide information about the O-site to T-site excitation energy.",,,,,,

An analysis of the data based on an empirical solubility model based on O-site occupation allows for an understanding of the data at low temperature, but probably is not a good starting place for understanding the solubility at high temperature. We have applied a recently developed empirical model for both O-site and T-site occupation to this data set, and find good agreement between data and a basic version of the model which assumes that the O-site and T-site partition functions are taken to be harmonic oscillator partition functions. Even better agreement is obtained when a more realistic O-site partition function is used. A range of optimum models with different assumptions about the T-site partition function is considered, and it is found to be possible to select one that matches the T-site occupation at zero loading inferred from neutron diffraction measurements of Pitt and Gray (Europhys. Let. 64 (2003) 344). The O-site to T-site excitation energy is assumed independent of temperature in these models, and we obtain specific model values of 105.3 meV for a-phase PdDX and 106.5 meV for a-phase PdHX.",,,,,,

"The theoretical problems associated with excess heat in the Fleischmann–Pons experiment were once viewed as insurmountable; nevertheless, some progress has been made in the past quarter century. Conceptually the problem can be split into one area involving new physics which is needed to address the microscopic physics of the reaction process; and a second area involving known physics which allows one to connect with the different practical issues involved in the experiments and observations. We review the ideas and progress first in the area of new physical mechanisms, in which models that describe the down-conversion of the large nuclear quantum allowing for coherent energy exchange of the nuclear energy into vibrational energy. These ideas provide a connection between excess heat experiments with Pd and Ni, with D or a mixture of H and D; experiments where tritium or low-level nuclear emission is seen, and other experiments with collimated X-ray emission. In the area of conventional physics mechanisms, we are interested in the basic physics of PdH and PdD; modeling cathode loading and understanding why some cathodes loaded very poorly in the early days; understanding active sites which we attribute to monovacancies in PdD and NiH; figuring out how active sites are created; triggering excess heat; and removing the helium made in the new reactions.",,,,,,

"Early statistical mechanics models for palladium hydride allowed for a good description of the phase diagram based on a simple parameterization of the O-site energy. In this work we study generalizations of these models to include higher-order dependence on loading, temperature-dependent O-site energies, and also to include T-site occupation. xperimental data sets for 10 isotherms were assembled, and augmented with additional extrapolated points for the low-pressure a-phase region as well as the high pressure ß-phase region. Loading-dependent O-site energies are optimized by minimizing the mean square error in the chemical potential between the model and data set. The resulting models give a good match to the phase diagram. If the O-site energy is allowed to be temperature dependent then the fit is better, but the resulting optimum is a mathematical optimum not so closely connected with the physical system. Models were studied in which O-site and T-site occupation occurs. When optimized these models are able to provide a good match to the phase diagram. When the O-site to T-site excitation energy is fixed according to estimates developed in earlier studies, the resulting temperature-dependent O-site energies are physically plausible. When the excitation energy are optimized together with the O-site energy, the resulting optimum is a mathematical one much less connected to the physical system. An earlier analysis of solubility in the a-phase led to a strong argument that T-site occupation occurs in palladium hydride and in palladium deuteriude; the present study supports this conclusion based on an independent data set.",,,,,,

"A composite is made up of constituent particles; the center of mass dynamics is that of a single particle, and the composite can have many internal states and degrees of freedom. The notion of a quantum composite is foundational to atomic, molecular, nuclear and particle physics; in our view it is also foundational to condensed matter nuclear science. It comes as a surprise that there do not appear to be review papers that discuss quantum composites. Here we consider elementary particles models, which are used to model composites; the most widely used example is that of the Dirac phenomenology for protons and neutrons. Quantum composite models can be developed from many-particle models, in some cases simply by rewriting in terms of center of mass and relative operators, and in other cases through a reduction or transformation. We have proposed models for anomalies in condensed matter nuclear science which rely heavily on the notion of a relativistic quantum composite. In the nonrelativistic case there is a clean separation of center of mass and internal degrees of freedom, so that any coupling between them must occur through external field interactions. The relativistic composite has a sizeable coupling between the center of mass motion and internal degrees of freedom, which we have proposed is responsible for the anomalies in condensed matter nuclear science. We have developed a new",,,,,,
"model in which the center of mass dynamics is modeled as nonrelativistic, but the internal structure is kept relativistic; this kind of model is much better adapted to problems in condensed matter nuclear science. Our approach has been strongly criticized, since in a Poincaré invariant theory the center of mass motion separates from the internal degrees of freedom in free space. We are able to rotate out the strongest part of this coupling in free space, consistent with Poincaré invariance. However, in the lattice the problem is in general much more complicated, and more powerful tools are required to diagonalize this relativistic coupling. The spin-boson type of models that we have considered previously for this are the simplest idealized models that can be diagonalized; they describe rich dynamics not present in the free-space version of the problem.",,,,,,

"Collimated X-ray emission near 1.5 keV in the Karabut experiment is an anomaly that cannot be explained by conventional solid state, atomic, or nuclear physics. In order for the X-rays to be collimated, there must either be an X-ray laser present, or else a phased-array collimation effect produced by emitting dipoles that radiate in phase. Although there have been arguments made in support of an X-ray laser origin of the effect, from our perspective this approach suffers from an absence of a plausible mechanism, short excited-state electronic lifetimes, high power requirements, and an incompatibility between the experimental geometry and the need for an elongated laser medium for beam formation. In this work we consider a model for beam formation due to many emitting dipoles randomly positioned within a circle on a mathematically flat surface. When the emitting dipole density is low, a speckle pattern is produced. Above a critical emitting dipole density beam formation occurs. The average intensity of the speckle and beam is estimated from simple statistical models at low and high dipole density, and combined to develop an empirical intensity estimate over the full range of dipole densities which compares well with numerical simulations. Beam formation occurs above a critical number of emitting dipoles, which allows us to develop an estimate for the minimum number of emitting dipoles present in the Karabut experiment. The effect of surface deformations is considered; constant offsets do not impact beam formation, and locally linear offsets direct the beam slightly off of normal. Minor displacements quadratic in the surface coordinates can produce focusing and defocusing effects, leading to a natural explanation for intense spot and line formation observed in the experiments.",,,,,,

"In recent years we have developed simple empirical mean-field statistical mechanics models for PdHx and PdDx that include both O-site and T-site occupation. A brief account of this work is given here. At low loading it is impossible to fit solubility data over a wide range of temperature assuming only O-site occupation; however, with T-site occupation a good fit is obtained and an O-site to T-site excitation energy near 105 meV is found. Results from neutron diffraction studies at modest loading, and resistance and solubility measurements at high pressure and high loading, are used to infer O-site to T-site excitation energies and develop a smooth fit. The resulting statistical mechanics models have been optimized to provide systematic results at high loading for PdH and PdD, and also to fit the isotherms of the phase diagram of PdH. Estimates for the O-site energy as a function of loading and temperature have been developed in the latter case.",,,,,,

"If we consider the nucleus as a relativistic composite, then we are able to derive from a many-particle Dirac model a coupling between the center of mass motion and internal nuclear degrees of freedom. This interaction can be rotated out in free space, but has the potential to give rise to new physics when two or more nuclei exchange phonons with a common vibrational mode. The simplest example of such a system is a homonuclear diatomic molecule in a frozen matrix, for which we are able to develop an expression for the second-order phonon–nuclear interaction that can result in a splitting of the nuclear energy levels as a result of excitation transfer between the nuclei. The phonon-nuclear coupling is an E1 interaction, so the low energy 6.237 keV E1 transition in 181Ta is special; this motivates an interest in molecular 181Ta2 as a candidate for a Mössbauer experiment where the splitting might be observable.

"Excitation transfer has long been of interest in biophysics, where electronic excitation is transferred from one location to another mediated by photon exchange. We are interested in the transfer of nuclear excitation mediated by phonon exchange, which according to our theoretical approach lies at the foundation of many anomalies in Condensed Matter Nuclear Science. The transfer of excitation from one site to another involves coupling to off-resonant intermediate states with either no excitation or double excitation; as such it is a quantum mechanical effect with no classical counterpart. The indirect coupling interaction can be determined from second-order perturbation theory for an electric dipole (E1) interaction, and the resulting interaction is weak due to destructive interference. We present results for resonant phonon-mediated excitation transfer based on the relativistic phonon-nuclear boost interaction identified recently. The analysis is extended to the more complicated case of magnetic dipole (M1) interactions, where fourth-order perturbation theory is needed for the interaction. We find severe destructive interference effects very much weaken the indirect interaction in both cases. Some improvement is possible due to loss; however, the improvement seems insufficient to account for the effects seen in excitation transfer experiments in our lab. To address this issue, we propose here that shifts in the off-resonant basis state energies could lead to much larger indirect interactions. The evaluation of shifts in the basis state energies is a major project, which requires the specification of the nucleon-nucleon interaction off of resonance, and the evaluation of off-resonant binding energies; these are projects to be addressed in the future. The transverse Breit interaction is given off of resonance. The resulting indirect interaction for excitation transfer is consistent with a delocalized transfer effect, and also with cooperative (Dicke) enhancements; we expect shifts in the basis state energies to lead to new models for up-conversion and downconversion as well. Possible connections between the model and recent experimental results from excitation transfer experiments involving a 57 Co source on steel are discussed. We also consider incoherent excitation transfer, where the large excitation associated with the D2/4 He transition is transferred to highly excited unstable states in the nuclei of the host lattice. While the mechanism was proposed many years ago to account for low-level emission of energetic alphas, there has subsequently been no clarification of mechanism associated with these experiments, which provides motivation for us to consider the possibility of confirming or rejecting the mechanism through a systematic study where the ejected particle energy is determined as a function of the nuclear mass of host lattice nuclei. The argument is extended to excitation transfer from the HD/3 He transition, where few MeV alpha emission may be a candidate explanation for the observations of Storms and Scanlan, and where proton emission from 6Li may be a candidate explanation for the 0.79MeV proton signal reported by Lipinski and Lipinski.",,,,,,

"The phase diagram of PdHX was first understood with the development of statistical mechanics models in the 1930s, where hydrogen atoms were modeled as occupying octahedral sites with an O-site energy that depended on the loading. In an earlier study we made use of a generalization of this kind of model to include both O-site and T-site occupation to model loading in the alpha phase, loading in the beta phase, and to develop a mean field model for the phase diagram of PdHX. Here we extend the modeling to develop a model phase diagram for PdDX. Since the PdDX phase diagram is less studied that the PdHx phase diagram, the selection of isotherms is an issue, and we encountered minor technical issues in the digitization of published isotherm data. It was possible to develop good extrapolations to low loading (required for our phase diagram optimization), but we found that a reliable extrapolation of isotherms at high temperature to high loading was not possible. Consequently, after some exploration we found that ""reasonable"" global phase diagram models could be obtained with the introduction of a ""guiding"" point, where we introduce an estimate for a single pressure at high temperature and high loading to constrain the O-site energies and resulting phase diagram. This underscores the need for experimental measurements in this regime in order to understand the phase diagram. We were successful in optimizing a mean field phase diagram model for PdDX using this approach. We made use of the isotherms from our earlier modeling for PdHX to develop a new phase diagram model for PdHX making use of the same basic approach. The resulting O-site energy curves are qualitatively similar, with a somewhat deeper binding for H at high loading (attributed to the increased lattice expansion), and larger spread in O-site energies as a function of temperature (attributed to the reduced number of configurations accessible at low energy due to the larger excitation energy of the lower mass hydrogen atom).",,,,,,

"In a subdivision process, the excitation from a nucleus in an excited state is transferred so as to produce excitation in two or more nuclei as a result of multi step excitation transfer. This has been proposed as a key component of excess heat models, where a large 24-MeV quantum needs to be broken down into many lower energy quanta. Here, we consider candidates for a new laboratory experiment in which subdivision might be studied in isolation. In such an experiment, the alpha or beta decay of a radioactive source produces an initially excited nucleus, and multiple excitation transfer steps lead to two excited nuclei with lower energy excitations, such that the total excitation energy approximately matches the initial excited state energy. A suitable candidate must include an initially excited nucleus that can be produced from a commercially available radioactive source, and two final excited states in stable nuclei, where the energy mismatch is sufficiently small that it can be made up by the exchange of a few optical laser photons. We searched through all relevant transitions in the NUDAT2 database below 250 keV and found four candidates for a laboratory subdivision experiment.",,,,,,

"Excess heat in the Fleischmann-Pons experiment implies the possibility of small-scale source of clean nuclear energy, with the potential to address climate change, finite oil supply, and clean water problems. Following the announcement on March 23, 1989, it took on the order of 40 days for the effect to be rejected, which has led to a bifurcation inwhich researchers in the field has studied the effect, and mainstream science general does not accept the existence of it. We consider the theoretical picture long studied in our group, and connections with experiment. The model involves many steps, and we have made an effort to connect as many of the theoretical steps as possible to experiments that seem to be closely related.",,,,,,

"Excess heat in the Fleischmann-Pons experiment presents numerous challenges for theorists, the biggest of which is to account for the absence of energetic nuclear particles in amounts commensurate with the energy produced. Our focus has been on the development of such a model, with recent progress reviewed. To account for excess heat production we contemplate a complicated model based on nuclear excitation transfer, subdivision and the down-conversion of keV nuclear quanta to a large number of phonons. The phonon-nuclear interaction that provides the foundation has been derived from a many-nucleon Dirac formalism, and we discuss recent efforts to confirm and improve upon the derivation. The quantification of the models under consideration require the evaluation of phonon-nuclear matrix elements, with recent progress discussed. The first step in the excess heat model involves the excitation transfer of a 24 MeV quantum associated with the D2/4He transition, which motivates a consideration of modeling and connections with experiments showing low-level energetic nuclear emissions. The analogous first step in the case of the 5.5 MeV quantum associated with the HD/3He transition is considered, where there is the possibility of low-level energetic nuclear emission, and where the issue of the availability of near-resonant energy levels can be studied. A nearby level in 137Cs is identified, which suggests a possible mechanism for the acceleration of the decay rate. We have recently revisited the issue of the null reaction, in which a D2/4He transition leads to the production of a compact D2 state from 4He, with the conclusion that this may be important in models for excess heat production and for low-level nuclear emission. Progress on subdivision is reviewed, including connections with experiments showing low-level nuclear emission, and candidates for laboratory tests. The possibility of a new 57Co/57Fe resonant excitation transfer experiment in a near single crystal sample is presented. A numerical approach for the evaluation of the rate for excess heat production in the models under discussion is discussed.",,,,,,

"The Irreproducibility and intermittency of the observed cold nuclear fusion effects is linked to the known difficulties affecting the observation of homogeneous nucleation of D2 bubbles on the surface of the cathode in the electrolysis of D2O. In general some nucleation centers are present, allowing for heterogeneous nucleation of D2 bubbles at the Pd, Ti or Zr cathode, long before the chemical potential of D in the cathode reaches the levels necessary for cold fusion. By carefully eliminating the impurities and surface defects which can act as nucleation centers, one can create homogeneous nucleation conditions which correspond to higher values of the cathodic D chemical potential, provided the cathode is completely covered by the electrolyte, or extremely large currents are applied to the cell. A decrease of the surface tension due to tensioactive impurities in the electrolyte must also be avoided. . . .",,,,,,

By now there have been many experimental results claiming to answer ""yes"" and which force us to take that possibility very seriously. As used here the ""large amounts"" are much larger than can possibly be explained by chemistry or metallurgy as known today. Up to now the only practical way of answering this question is by Pd/D calorimetry. . . .",,,,,,

En mulig forklaring kunne være fusjon av to deuteriumatomer til helium-4 og begrepet ""kald fusjon "" ble født. Oppdagelsen ga håp om at en uuttømmelig kilde til energi kunne utvikles.

These small clusters, called spherons, are usually helions (i.e. a particles), tritons and dineutrons. In nuclei containing an odd number of neutrons, a 3He cluster or a deuteron may serve as a spheron. The close-packed-spheron model differs from the conventional liquid-drop model of the nucleus in having spherons rather than nucleons as the units. This is a simplification: 154Gd, for example, is described in terms of 45 spherons, rather than 154 nucleons. This enables one to determine the systematic of binding energy in a much simpler way than the approach based on individual nucleons. The author developed that idea, i.e. having clusters as basic bricks within the nucleus instead of nucleons. He considered the binding energy of a particle, deuterium, tritium, 3He, and the way these spherons are bonded instead of the bonding between individual nucleons. According to that hypothesis the nuclei of the various isotopes of each element are constituted out of a particles and other nucleons grouped in order to form sub-nuclei bound together by four types of bonds called NN, NP, NNP and NPP. So, the author favored an approach trying to breakdown the binding energy value of each element isotope in the sub-values indicated above. That binding energy distribution approach in the nuclei is essential to the comprehension of LENR process.",,,,,,

"Dark Gravity (DG) theories are extensions of General Relativity having a stable anti-gravitational sector. From the beginning, the motivation for such an extended framework was not only phenomenological, trying to address several well-known enigmatic cosmological discoveries in an alternative way: missing mass effects, universe acceleration, ... but also theoretical, and the main achievement is that indeed, it is possible to avoid most if not all generic instability issues which are well known to prevent the introduction of negative masses in General Relativity. Moreover it was also shown that such constructions are not arbitrary but can be entirely derived following the alternative mathematical choice for understanding the Time Reversal Symmetry, that of a Unitary T operator in QFT, needing a complete rehabilitation of negative energies in theoretical physics. All versions of DG theories studied so far unsurprisingly share many phenomenological outcomes, but here we shall focus on one which, for the first time, very naturally leads us to investigate the likely existence of genuine field discontinuities. The resulting phenomenology started to be explored. The first part of the article is a reminder of the main steps that led us to Dark Gravity. The second part focuses on discontinuities to show that these are all we need to explain in an unifying and very simple way many if not all of the well known so called ""LENR miracles"": Large eXcess Power (XP) not possibly of chemical origin with extremely low levels of nuclear radiations (alpha, beta, gamma, neutrons) as compared to what would be expected from nuclear processes producing the same amount of energy, Transmutations and isotopic anomalies in cold conditions, Incredible properties such as huge inertia anomalies and temperature discontinuities of a new category of objects produced in association with LENR and behaving as extremely magnetic micro ball lightnings.",,,,,,

"A previous article paved the way from a dark gravity theory (DG) toward LENR. This article is intended to go beyond the conceptual foundations (which will only be briefly summarized), and to provide a more technical detailed road map. An important revision of the theory was also made necessary by the recent direct detection of gravitational waves by Ligo. Finally, justifications will be given for adopting a slightly modified view of the process that triggers the formation of micro lightning balls, those enigmatic objects being produced in association with (and arguably responsible for) LENR, as we have recently identified the key role being played by a local increase of the density of electrons by various methods including a high luminosity beam (pulse) of electrons on a target.",,,,,,

"Unusual nuclear transmutation reactions have been reported by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI). In their experiment, D2 gas permeates through a Pd complexes, which consists of a thin Pd layer, alternating CaO and Pd layers and bulk Pd. When they used sample Pd complexes with additional Cs on the surface, Pr emerged on the surface while Cs decreased after the sample was subjected to D2 gas permeation at 343 K and 1 atm for about one week. The elemental analysis was performed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). This phenomenon was reproduced qualitatively in the present replication experiment.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"We performed D-permeation experiments similar to the MHI’s experiment three times, and we confirmed the production of Pr. Pd complex samples were provided to us by MHI. The surface was electrolytically cleaned to remove hydrocarbons before depositing Cs. D2 gas was permeated through the Pd complexes at 343 K and 1 atm for about 5 days. Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) was performed to analyze the existence of the elements (Cs and Pr) and the mass distribution. The results showed the existence of Pr. And we also confirmed the existence of Pr by using fast Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) in Fusion Neutronics Source (FNS) of Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI).",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"As a result, we confirmed that the nuclear transmutation reaction, from 133Cs to 141Pr, was occurred. This transmutation suggests that the mass numbers and atomic numbers increase 8 and 4, respectively. The model of multi-body resonance fusion of deuterons proposed by A. Takahashi2 can explain this mass-8-and-charge-4 increased transmutation.",,,,,,

Lumped electrical analogues for thermal components allow well developed electrical simulation technologies to quickly solve time domain thermal problems. Once the thermal model for a system is extracted, the simulation is accurate enough to detect possible experimental errors and inconsistencies. In addition, the unknown excess heat can be readily de-embedded from the typically long time constant of the calorimeter, enabling better time alignment of the excess heat response to the inputs that may have been the proximate cause for the effect.",,,,,,

"Hydrogen absorption capacity and heat evolution upon loading with hydrogen/deuterium gas were measured for Pd-ZrO2 nanocomposite obtained from Santoku Corporation. In order to examine the influence of oxidized Pd on both hydrogen absorption capacity and heat evolution, the measurements were performed three times repeatedly. Prior to each measurement, the samples were heat treated in vacuum at 523K for more than 2 hours. The first time measurement gave an apparent H/Pd ratio of 2.6 and a heat evolution of 2.6eV/Pd. During the first time measurement, the oxidized Pd was reduced to metallic Pd. It was found that the H/Pd ratio at 1MPa was slightly smaller than that of Pd bulk. It was also noted that Pd nanoparticles grow significantly during the cycles of absorption and desorption of hydrogen. When the sample was loaded with deuterium, intermittent heat evolutions as small as at most 0.1W were observed in the second stage where heat evolutions arising from chemical reactions were hardly expected.",,,,,,

"Using Sievert’s method, the hydrogen (/deuterium) absorption capacitywas measured for Pd nanopowder with particle size 10-20 nm and for Pd-?Al2O3 nanocomposites with Pd particle size 2-5 nm. In order to eliminate the influence of oxidized Pd particles on the absorption capacity, measurements were repeated three or four times without exposing the samples to air. For both nano-Pd materials, the absorption capacity at 1MPa was found to be slightly smaller than that of Pd bulk. The difference in the absorption capacity between hydrogen and deuterium, i.e., the isotope effect, was negligible within the experimental error. It was found that the average size of the Pd particles was significantly increased after the repeated measurements of the absorption capacity. The heat generated upon pressurizing the materials with deuterium or hydrogen up to 1MPa was measured using a flow calorimeter. Similar to the measurements of absorption capacity, the heat measurements were also conducted repeatedly. The observed heat generation was composed of two stages, i.e., the first stage during pressurizing the samples from 0 to 1 MPa and the second stage, where the sample was kept under a fixed pressure of 1 MPa. The heat generated in the first stage was much larger at the time of the first measurement than at the second or third. The heat generated in the first stage was largely explained by taking into account two chemical reactions, i.e., the water formation reaction and the deuteride formation reaction. It was noted that in the second stage, where the heat generated from chemical reactions was hardly expected to occur, a small heat power was observed intermittently. This heat evolution was observed frequently when the samples were loaded with deuterium.",,,,,,

"Factors affecting the deuterium permeation rate through Pd foils at a temperature as low as 70?C have been studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It has been demonstrated that the surface segregation of S from the interior of Pd bulk during the permeation process causes a significant lowering of permeation rate with increasing permeation time, although the concentration of S impurity in Pd bulk is probably less than 10 ppm. The surface accumulated S during D2 permeation also gives rise to a difficulty in detecting small amount of elements on the surface of Pd after deuterium permeation treatment. For selected nuclear transmutation from Sr to Mo reported by Iwamura group, we have successfully observed Mo on the surface of Sr ion-implanted Pd after a deuterium permeation treatment, by adding a process that removes the sulfur accumulated on the surface of the Pd foil. A time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS) study on the origin of the observed Mo will be described in a separate paper.",,,,,,

In this paper, the synthesis of nano-Pd particles embedded in the meso-pores of a mesoporous-silica is reported. We have succeeded in synthesizing nano-Pd particle systems with an average Pd particle size of 3.60 nm and a standard deviation of 0.64 nm. It was found that the synthesized nano-Pd particle system is very stable, i.e., the average size of the Pd particle is unchanged when exposed to a hydrogen atmosphere at temperatures ranging from room temperature up to 773 K. The hydrogen absorption capacity of the nano-Pd particles in the mesoporous silica host at room temperature was smaller than that of the Pd bulk.",,,,,,

"Confirmation of the model of field screened long range nuclear reactions has been obtained from the isotopes produced by nuclear Reactions In a Film-Excited CompleX (RIFEX) using nickel and nickel/palladium films, electrolytically loaded with hydrogen. The isotopes result from thermal proton (or deuterium or triton) reactions. The process is based on high Coulomb screening including :he Swimming Electrons of the double Layer (SEL) at the surface of metals or at the interfaces between different metals due to the diffcrences of the Fermi levels. These long rangc reactions for the low energy (nearly thermal) impact nuclei permits very long interaction times at thc large distances. The quantum relations for the values of the energies, distances and times involved arc :iiseussed and compared with the situation for the high energies at shorter distances in thc usual hot fusion and MeV nuclear reactions. Comparing these long range rcactions with fission thermal reactions leads to the suggestion that the missing exchange of largc momenta lead to the emission of lower energy gammas. from rotational and vibrational or surfacc states of the daughter nuclei. These may account for the large amount of energy of the exothermic reactions measured in the RIFEX experiments.",,,,,,

"The recently used solid state physics analysis resulted in the surprising fact that the protons or deuterons in host metals as nickel, palladium or similars not only produce nuclear fusion but result in other reactions with the nuclei of the host materials generating nuclear transmutations. The resulting nuclides with atomic numbers Z are spread over the whole table of the periodic system. Based on our models of having the protons as an exotic plasma whose most energetic tail of about 1 to 2 eV reacts within about 2 pm distance where the Coulomb repulsion is reduced by screening, especially in the swimming electron layer, we derive a relation to the magic numbers of the nuclear shell model from the measured Z-dependence of the reaction probabilities. This agreement with the magic numbers is an excellent proof of consistency for the measurements. Furthermore, new higher magic numbers are predicted.",,,,,,

"For summarizing theoretical papers of the ICCF9 conference, a short reminder should be given about some significant experimental results that can form a basis for a theory of low energy nuclear reactions (LENR). For a more historic view, the motivation for the Fleischmann-Pons experiment or the Preparata effect were well explained while-as an unusual view-L. Case reported that experiments may be understood by a simple chemical process involving catalytic surface properties. This could also explain why heat production happens in some cases and not in other cases. Contrary to this is the history of the observation of neutron emission from palladium compounds [1] or from deuterated palladium [2] that indicate nuclear processes. Today we have the significant result of Tian, Li et al [3] that the reaction of palladium wires after reacting with a hydrogen atmosphere during a current discharge, when the energy input was stopped and the gas evacuated, generated ""heat after dead"" for 43 hours producing about 3.6kW/cm^3 or 13 keV/atom Pd . . .",,,,,,

"ABSTRACT Conversion of deuterium to tritium in palladium has been clearly confirmed by the Arata-Zhang experiments. Endothermic element synthesis in Pd. and/or Ni layers due to high proton concentration, in analogy to stellar synthesis can be seen from the generation of very rare elements such as terbium. A convincing explanation is necessary. It was concluded phenomenologically that the reaction of the protons or deuterons by fusion or with the nuclei of the host metal occurs at a distance of about picometers with a reaction time of about megaseconds. It was noted that the Bohr radius rB of hydrogen atoms in a dielectric with refractive index n is changed to rBn2. such that with the electron concentration of the host metals a plasma refractive index of 0.076 results in a value of 3pm. In order to understand the subsequent dielectric modification of the ionization energy, we apply the model of depression of this energy by the Inglis-Teller effect for which a model with the best agreement with plasma experiments was presented before. For our model of the dielectrically shrunk picometer hydrogen atoms, the low ionization energies result in a reasonable relation between dielectric properties and the effective Debye length. Preference of the reaction at surfaces or interfaces between different host metals are due to the same reduction of the dielectric response as observed with surface plasmons. For the swimming electron layer theory, the spreading of the double layer for metal interfaces was discussed.",,,,,,

"Since the appeal by Brian Josephson at the meeting of the Nobel Laureates July 2004, it seems to be indicated to summarize the following serious, reproducible and confirmed observations on reactions of protons or deuterons incorporated in host metals such as palladium. Some reflections to Rutherford’s discovery of nuclear physics, the Cockroft-Oliphant discovery of anomalous low energy fusion reactions and the chemist Hahn’s discovery of fission had to be included. Using gaseous atmosphere or discharges between palladium targets, rather significant results were seen e.g. from the ""life after death"" heat production of such high values per host atom that only nuclear reactions can be involved. This supports the earlier evaluation of neutron generation in fully reversible experiments with gas discharges hinting that a reasonable screening effect - preferably in the swimming electron layer - may lead to reactions at nuclear distances d of picometers with reaction probability times U of about megaseconds similar to the K-shell capture radioactivity. Further electrolytic experiments led to Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR) where the involvement of pollution could be excluded from the appearance of very seldom rare earth elements. A basically new theory for DD cross sections is used to confirm the picometer-megasecond reactions of cold fusion. Other theoretical aspects are given from measured heavy element distributions similar to the standard abundance distribution, SAD, in the Universe with consequences on endothermic heavy nuclei generation, magic numbers and to quark-gluon plasmas.",,,,,,

One of the most convincing facts about LENR due to deuterons of very high concentration in host metals as palladium is the measurement of the large scale minimum of the reaction probability depending on the nucleon number A of generated elements at A = 153 where a local maximum was measured. This is similar to the fission of uranium at A = 119 where the local maximum follows from the Maruhn-Greiner theory if the splitting nuclei are excited to about MeV energy. The LENR generated elements can be documented any time after the reaction by SIMS or K-shell X-ray excitation to show the very unique distribution with the local maximum. An explanation is based on the strong Debye screening of the Maxwellian deuterons within the degenerate rigid electron background especially within the swimming electron layer at the metal surface or at interfaces. The deuterons behave like neutrals at distances of about 2 picometers. They may form clusters due to soft attraction in the range above thermal energy. Clusters of 10 pm diameter may react over long time probabilities (megaseconds) with Pd nuclei leading to a double magic number compound nucleus which splits like in fission to the A = 153 element distribution.,,,,,,

The discovery of nuclear fission by Hahn and Straßmann was based on a very rare microanalytical result what initially could not indicate the very complicated details of this most important process. A similarity is discussed for the low energy nuclear reactions (LENR) being proved from analogies of measurements of uranium fission. The distribution of the elements with uranium fission is similar to the element distribution with LENR. This was observed repeatedly and reproducibly with high density deuteron concentration in palladium. This discussion is specifically focussed to the Maruhn-Greiner local maximum of the distribution within the large-scale minimum if the fission nuclei are excited. The consequences of the complications in uranium fission are discussed in comparison with LENR with respect to the studies of a hypothetical fissioning compound nuclear reaction via a concluded element 306X126 with double magic numbers.,,,,,,

"Results about low energy nuclear reactions (LENR) are related to very high density clusters of deuterons where properties of Bose-Einstein condensation and/or inverted Rydberg states are compared. A modification of Bohr’s atom model is used to overcome the problem that a quantum state with n = 1 does not emit radiation from an ""orbiting"" electron. This permits then the description of the inverted state of Rydberg matter in agreement with the recent measurements of Holmlid et al. for deuterium clusters with ultra-high deuteron densities in the range of 1029cm-3. A virtual oscillation model for laser excitation clusters explains the low intensity ionization threshold in clusters. MeV particle emission from LENR can then be compared with measurements from inverted Rydberg states.",,,,,,

"The 23rd International Conference on Condensed Matter Nuclear Science (ICCF-23) was held as a virtual conference, during June 9th-11th, 2021, due to the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic and related travel restrictions. With the full support from the International Advisory Committee, the Local Organizing Committee (LOC) made great efforts to promote the development of the field of Condensed Matter Nuclear Science (CMNS). In order to attract researchers and people who were interested in participating in the conference, the LOC did not charge registration fees. The conference was organized and technically supported by the Innovation Laboratory for Sciences and Technologies of Energy Materials of Fujian Province (IKKEM), the State Key Laboratory of Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces (PCOSS), and Xiamen University of China.",,,,,,

"At ICCF-22, we presented a vapor compression machine (VCS) which can produce excess energy. The hot refrigerant vapor from the freon compressor is used to heat the water flowing through a tiny passage of a triple-pipe heat exchanger (THX). This can cause a violent cavitation of water and two-phase flow instabilities, and produce excess energy. The VCS machine was further modified and tested for two years since then. We improved the calorimetry in measuring COP. From the energy balance of THX, we defined COP as the net heat output from water divided by the net heat input to THX, which is denoted as COPx. If the measured COPx was greater than 1, we can confirm the occurrence of excess energy generation or the low energy nuclear reaction (LENR). The test results show that the maximum COPx reaches 2.39 and COPx increases with decreasing inlet water temperature. We observed some peculiar phenomena. The output refrigerant vapor from the compressor is, instead, heated by water at some part of the heat exchanger. In addition, abnormally-high water line pressure damaged the pressure gauge, and also caused crack and leakage of the copper pipe. We also observed severe buckling and black appearance of the middle pipe. The buckling may result from a huge exerted pressure around 740 bar which is far beyond the system operating pressure. This may be caused by LENR. We also made another machine (DHX-1) using a double-pipe heat exchanger heated by a steam boiler. The maximum COPx reaches 2.55 and some peculiar phenomena similar to the VCS machine was observed. The inner copper pipe was deformed by buckling and the outer pipe wall was cracked and leaked. This may be caused by huge pressure (>225 bar) or a high temperature (>500?C) which results in buckling and rupture of the pipes. The surface of the ruptured inner pipe becomes shining black and looks like CuO nanowires produced by thermal oxidation of copper. The chemical element of the ruptured copper pipe increases by 3 to 4 folds in C, 10 folds in O, and 1.4 to 4.4 folds in Fe. Replacing the identical brand-new double-pipe heat exchanger (DHX-1B), we obtained the same results as DHX-1 with COPx > 2.0, inner pipe rupture and blackening, and chemical element change. COPx > 2.0 also occurred in a new heat exchanger (DHX-2) made from stronger copper tubes with a larger size. All of these excess-energy phenomena in VCS and DHX are probably induced by LENR. In the present study, we experimentally confirm that excess energy or LENR can be induced by a heat transfer process involving cavitation in heat-exchange systems. The excess energy process has been shown reproduceable and controllable.",,,,,,

"In early 90’s, Ken Shoulders was granted 5 patents on Exotic Vacuum Objects (EVO) claiming that they were a new form of matter. He produced many monographs about them and suggested they were the physics that explained cold fusion. In Ken Shoulders words, EVO’s are, ""Highly organized, micron-sized clusters of electrons, having soliton behavior, with electron populations density on the order of Avogadro’s number per cm3 (A typical 2µm EVO has a population of 1011 to 1013 electrons). When interacted with solid material, these charge clusters perform a low-energy phase transformation type of atomic disruption that liquefies the lattice and propels the material to a high velocity without apparent signs of conventional heating. Using an ordinary thermal interpretation, a thermal gradient for bulk material greater than 26,000 degrees C per micrometer would be required to achieve these effects"". This paper presents lessons from thin film deposition methods like Vacuum Arc, Pulsed Electron beam, Pulsed Laser whose commonality with EVO generation is pulse energy impingement on a target. Rather than the hypothesis of a ""new form of matter"" as an explanation of EVO’s, it is hypothesized that generation of a micro shaped-charge, in analogy with explosively formed shaped-charge munitions, can explain the characteristics of surfaces that were struck by EVO’s. This hypothesis reproduces the effects that are underlined in the text above.",,,,,,

Abstract,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"A number of features of the presence of interstitial species in metals and alloys relevant to ""solid state fusion"" experiments are discussed. These include experimental evidence for very high virtual pressures under certain conditions, and the influence of promotors and surface blockers. Dislocation generation and motion can result from the large stresses accompanying composition gradients and phase transformations. Because of preferential segregation of interstitial species to dislocations, transport along dislocations can be much faster than through the bulk crystal, and dislocation motion can cause unusually rapid interstitial solute transport and both entry and emission from surfaces. Mechanical effects related to the presence of hydrogen often are sporadic and can have long delay times. It is possible that some of the same microstructural features and phenomena that are responsible for delayed mechanical behavior play an important role in the ""solid state fusion"" observations. Two dislocation mechanisms are presented that can produce transient local hyperloading.",,,,,,

"Abstract. Mechanisms that are involved in the loss of capacity upon the cycling of electro­chemical cells are discussed. The inherent instability of the electrochemical interface and the resul­tant geometrical changes are characteristic of electrodes in which the reactant is a pure element. On the other hand, decrepitation can play an important role in the case of polyphase electrodes in which significant changes in specific volume occur. A simple one-dimensional model is presented that shows the mechanism and the important parameters that are involved in particle fracture. It predicts that decrepitation will lead to a terminal particle size, as is found experimentally.",,,,,,

"An overview of our experiments and their results concerning the electron screening effects in metallic environments are presented. The measurements of the reactions 2H(d,p)3H and 2H(d,n)3He were performed with an electrostatic accelerator at incident deuteron energies between 5 and 60keV at different self-implanted target materials. The resulting screening energy values are about one order of magnitude larger compared to gas target experiments and exceed significantly the theoretical predictions. A thorough investigation of the processes in the targets under ion irradiation shows that there are multi-parameter collateral effects which are crucial for the correct interpretation of the observed enhancements. They mainly originate from target surface contaminations due to residual gases in the vacuum as well as from inhomogeneities in the deuteron density distribution in heterogeneous targets. For the special situation of deuterium in the metallic environment an improved analysis method has been developed beyond the standard procedures. Experimental evidence for the influence of such effects and a mathematical model for their assessment are given and compared with the results of other groups. We also present a numerical model of the electron screening effect in metallic lattices based on an ab-initio Hartree-Fock simulation.",,,,,,

"Recent measurements of the reaction 2H(d,p)3H in metallic environments at very low energies performed by different experimental groups point to an enhanced electron screening effect. However, the resulting screening energies differ strongly for diverse host metals and different experiments. Here, we present new experimental results and investigations of interfering processes in the irradiated targets. These measurements inside metals set special challenges and pitfalls that make them and the data analysis particularly error prone. There are multiparameter collateral effects that are crucial for the correct interpretation of the observed experimental yields. They mainly originate from target surface contaminations owing to residual gases in the vacuum as well as from inhomogeneities and instabilities in the deuteron density distribution in the targets. To address these problems an improved differential analysis method beyond the standard procedures has been implemented. Profound scrutiny of the other experiments demonstrates that the observed unusual changes in the reaction yields are mainly due to deuteron density dynamics simulating the alleged screening energy values. The experimental results are compared with different theoretical models of the electron screening in metals. The Debye-Hückel model that has been previously proposed to explain the influence of the electron screening on both nuclear reactions and radioactive decays can be clearly excluded.",,,,,,

Abstract A series of measurements have been performed on a thin sheet of Pd in D2 gas atmo­sphere with an electric field applied across its length. The results in terms of correlation between the average loading ratio near the cathode and in the middle of the sheet are reported: they indicate that under particular conditions the application of the electric field succeeds to shorten the loading time and to obtain local D/Pd ratios higher than the average value.,,,,,,

These helium peaks and unnatural counts are difficult to explain and might have something to do with the multibody fusion reactions proposed by A. Takahashi.

A compact scheme of non-thermonuclear fusion is presented. Hydrogen ions are implanted directly from nonthermal discharge plasma or ion source into a surface of liquid Li metal at a buffer energy of a few tens keV where nuclear stopping occurs. The ions interact with Li atoms or mixed element atoms which are not being internally excited and tend towards the formation of united atoms at the minimum Gibbs free energy point. This leads to the enhanced rate of non-thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen ions due to cohesion in the liquid metal.,,,,,,

"Most Low Energy Nuclear Reaction (LENR) electrochemical experiments have been performed with commercially pure palladium cathodes. There has also been interest in the use of alloys of palladium, which retain the ability of that element to absorb high fractions of deuterium, but also offer better mechanical properties. Alloying palladium with low levels of boron is a prime example. The fabrication and characterization of Pd–B alloys is described in this paper. Three alloys with nominal composition in weight percent of boron, 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75, were produced by arc melting, followed by annealing. Transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction showed them to consist of two face-centered cubic phases with different lattice parameters, one dispersed as fine particles within the other. It was found that these alloys produce highly reliable LENR results.",,,,,,

"The electrolysis of heavy water is being investigated with two types of open calorimetric systems. Pd cathodes, Pt anodes and D2O/0.1 M LiOD electrolytes have been used. Until now no clear-cut heat bursts as reported have been observed. One exceptional phenomenon showing abnormal power imbalance without neutron and tritium anomalies was found, but has not been repeated under the similar experimental conditions. Neutron emission, on the other hand, as a very rare case showed an abnormal increase for only short term during one of another series of experiments. The increase of about 3.8 sigma above the background level lasted for 9 hours on the 20th day after starting the electrolysis. The emission rate amounts to about 27.2 ± 11.2 neutrons s^-l, which is equivalent to about 700 times as much as the background level. Neither excess heat nor tritium anomalies were, however, observed. The reason for the lack of repeatability of these experimental results is discussed.",,,,,,

The burst occurred just during the calm period about 6 hours after the fIrst boiling. The temperature of the cell, about 100 ml in volume, increased by 7.5 K in 13 minutes .

"A heat burst equivalent to 360W per lcm3 of Pd was observed in an open type electrolysiS cell using Pd/O.lMLiOD/pt. It happened. however. only once in all 5 cells ever tested. Although boiling has occurred many times in all cells, no direct correlation has been found between boiling and 4He production. By reducing the gas flow rate and properly adjusting the pressure gradient, the quantitative analysis of 4He could be realized in our Q-mass system with high detection sensitivity (l7ppt) in continuous-flow mode and with high resolution in store mode. Two types of closed vacuum furnace were used to degas the Pd samples. An external-heater-type allowed penneation of 4He and H from air when heated above IOOOoe. An internal-heater-type. on the other hand. enabled us to heat up the sample at 1200°C without any penneation. No traces of 4He were, however, detected probably due to one of three possible reasons: I)There have been no 4He in the Pd sample from the beginning. 2)4He was degassed away during the 1st heating at 770°C, but could not be detected due to the then insufficient sensitivity. 3)4He still exists in the Pd lattice, but cannot migrate nor diffuse even at 1200°C, forming many trapped tiny bubbles.",,,,,,

"[Abstract] Procedures and results of three kinds of experiments i.e., closed type D2O/Pd electrolysis, electron beam irradiation and ion-beam bombardment on titanium-deuteride (TiDx) have been introduced in this paper. In the electrolysis experiment, upper gas of the electrolysis cell was analyzed using a Quadrupole Mass Analysis System (Q-MAS). Significant amount of helium-4 was detected without neutron emission in several experiments and in one of these experiments, the amount of helium-4 atom in the released gas from the palladium cathode was 8.1 x 10^16 atoms. Under electron beam irradiation to highly D-loaded palladium, anomalous spectra were taken in X-ray measurement. In the experiments using deuteron beam and TiDx, responses which suggested 3D multi-body fusion were taken and the reaction rate of which was increased compared to the D(d,p)T reaction rate, below 100 keV. This result may reflect the coherent effect of the solid state in the reactions. From the results of the experiments using proton beam and TiDx, peaks which suggested 3D multi-body reaction were detected with high reproducibility. Moreover, high energetic protons having 17-20 MeV emitted kinetic energy which suggested H-D-D three-body coherent fusion were also detected.",,,,,,

A meaningful increase of helium-4 was observed during electrolysis with the Pd-D2O system, while neutron emission was not observed. The D+D+D fusion, 3D→t+3He+9.5 MeV, has been observed repeatedly in deuteron-beam irradiation experiments with a TiDx target.

"A new experimental setup based on Mizuno’s work was introduced in our lab in order to investigate the anomalous heat generation phenomena. Following Mizuno’s procedures, we fabricated nano-structured material composed of Pd and Ni by glow discharge on a heater located in the center of a vacuum chamber. The nano-structured Pd/Ni was prepared with D2 before use. Then, we applied electrical power to the heater that was covered with the nano-structured Pd/Ni while evacuating the chamber, and we observed the heater temperature behavior. Next, we introduced D2 gas at about 250 Pa to the chamber while maintaining the heater input. As a result, in three experiments, we observed that heater temperature increases compared to the reference experiment (with no nano-structured Pd/Ni). In particular, in experiments with 7 W input, we observed a123?C heater temperature increase compared to the reference experiment. It can be said that we replicated Mizuno’s experiment successfully. Since the heater was covered with nano-structured material, there was a concern that a change in emissivity affected the heater temperature measurement. Numerical calculation was conducted to evaluate the effect of the change of the surface emissivity. It was concluded that even if the emissivity drop dramatically from 0.7 to 0.3 due to the coating of the nano-structured Pd/Ni, the temperature rise would be only 70?C at the most. The postulated emissivity change cannot explain the observed temperature increase of 123?C. These experimental and numerical results suggest that anomalous excess heat was generated by the interaction between nano-structured Pd/Ni surface and D2 gas.",,,,,,

"We have constructed a photon measurement system to observe the radiant power emitted from an NiCu multilayer film for a wide energy range, from visible light to mid-infrared light. Using the new system, we attempted to measure the radiation from the sample when a heat burst occurred while anomalous excess heat was being continuously generated. About 10 big burst events were observed during the 5-day continuous measurement: it was found that the radiation intensity increased simultaneously as the heater temperature suddenly increased. We have made a comparison of the radiant spectrum of the burst event with the spectrum in normal times. There is no particular difference due to the burst; both spectra can be simply interpreted as grey body radiation emitted from a thermally equilibrated object. The correlation of radiant intensity between near-IR and visible light has been deduced; although it is expected there is a linear correlation between them, two correlation lines can be drawn instead of one. This indicates that the contribution of photon emission from the non-equilibrium stage may have an effect.",,,,,,

"Two kinds of experimental methods have been designed to induce nuclear reactions in the Pd-D system. One is the D2 gas diffusion method, and the other is the electrolysis diffusion method. A common feature of the methods is to cause continuous diffusion of deuterium through a multi-layer Pd that contains low work function material (CaO, TiC, YzOs, etc.). Time dependence of nuclear products (Mg, Si, S, F, Al) were observed by the D2 gas diffusion method, in which the products were analyzed WITHOUT taking the multi-layer Pd out of the apparatus. The time dependence of the products was reproduced qualitatively. The 33S/32S ratio of the products was one order larger than that of natural abundance. Fe isotope ratio anomaly of the multi-layer Pd obtained by the electrolysis diffusion method was confirmed by SIMS and TOF-SIMS. Si powder products detected after electrolysis amounted to 0.057g, and its isotopic composition was anomalous.",,,,,,

The device 10 that produces nuclide transmutation comprises a structure body 11 that is substantially plate shaped and made of palladium (Pd) or palladium alloy, or another metal that absorbs hydrogen (for example, Ti) or an alloy thereof, and a material 14 that undergoes nuclide transmutation laminated on one surface 11A among the two surfaces of this structure body 11. The one surface 11A side of the structure body 11, for example, is made a region in which the pressure of the deuterium is high due to pressure or electrolysis and the like, and the other surface 11B side, for example, is a region in which the pressure of the deuterium is low due to vacuum exhausting and the like, and thereby, a flow of deuterium in the structure body 11 is produced, and nuclide transmutation is carried out by a reaction between the deuterium and the material 14 that undergoes nuclide transmutation.",,,,,,

Many experimental results showed that the quantity of Pr was proportional to the deuterium flux through Pd complex.

"We have been studying low energy nuclear transmutations induced by D2 gas permeation through Pd complexes (Pd/CaO/Pd). We presented experimental results at ICCF9 and ICCF101-3. In this paper, we report recent progress. Transmutations of Ba into Sm were observed in two cases: with natural Ba on Pd complex samples (a definite result), and with mass 137-enriched Ba (probable). In these experiments, the atomic mass increase was 12 and atomic number increase was 6. One of our experimental apparatuses was carried to SPring-8, which is the world's largest synchrotron radiation facility, located at Hyogo prefecture in Japan. Pr was confirmed several times by XRF at SPring-8. Some experiments were done to explore physical structure of the CaO layer. According to a D+ ion beam bombardment experiment performed at Tohoku University, the deuterium density of our Pd complex is one order larger than normal Pd. When we replaced CaO with MgO, we did not obtain any positive results. These results shed light on the role of the CaO layer in the Pd complex.",,,,,,

"In-situ measurement of transmutation of Cs into Pr was performed, and the surface distribution of Pr was investigated using XRF (X-Ray Fluorescence spectrometry) at SPring-8, a large synchrotron x-ray facility. The in-situ measurement indicated that Pr emerged and Cs decreased at some points after D2 gas permeation, though any Pr cannot be observed before D2 gas permeation at all the points on the Pd complex surface. Using small size X-ray beam in 100- and 500-micrometer squares, we obtained 2 dimensional XRF spectra for three permeated samples, from which we detected Pr. Pr was detected again by the two small x-ray beams as expected. The amount of Pr varied greatly at different locations of the Pd surface, however, a clear correlation between surface structures and distribution of Pr has not seen up to now. Experimental results suggest that nuclear transmutations do not occur uniformly but some uncertain factors, presumably condensed matter effects in the present Pd/D/CaO system, have a large effect on the rate or the process of the reactions.",,,,,,

"We built a new experimental system to replicate the anomalous heat generation experiments based on the papers by A. Kitamura and A. Takahashi. The system was developed in order to measure precisely heat generation using a flow-calorimetry method with liquid hydrocarbon coolant that enables us to measure at temperatures higher than 373 K. The Ni-based binary nano-composite samples were prepared by the melt spinning method. A fabricated material at Kobe University were separated into two samples. One sample was loaded and tested at Tohoku University and the other at Kobe University, in order to compare the experimental results at the two different places. Two experiments were performed up to now. One was the PNZ4s (Pd0:044Ni0:31Zr0:65) with D2 gas experiment and the other is the CNZ5s (Cu0:044Ni0:31Zr0:65) with H2 gas experiment. For the PNZ4s with D2 gas experiment, excess heat up to 10 W was observed. The amount of excess energy reached 2.5 MJ and it corresponded to 14.9 eV per absorbed D. CNZ5s (Cu0:044Ni0:31Zr0:65) with H2 gas experiment also showed anomalous excess heat ranging from 2 to 5 W. Coincident increase events of the pressure of reaction chamber and gas temperature, which suggested high temperature gas generation in the reactor chamber, was observed many times. The amount of excess energy amounted to 1.9 MJ and the generated energy per hydrogen atom was estimated as 67.8 eV/H. For the both samples subjected to the same fabrication process, results of the present work qualitatively agreed with those of the similar experiment performed at Kobe University. And these observations are supposed to be very difficult to explain by known chemical processes only.",,,,,,

"New type of excess heat experiments using a nano-sized metal multilayer composite and hydrogen gas have been performed based on the permeation-induced transmutation experiments with multilayer thin film and excess heat experiments with nano-particles. Two nano-sized metal multilayer composite samples, which were composed of Ni, Cu, CaO, Y2O3 thin films on bulk Ni (25 mm × 25 mm × 0.1 mm), were placed in a vacuum chamber. These samples were fabricated by Ar ion beam sputtering method. After baking of the samples, H2 gas was introduced into the chamber up to about 230 Pa at 250 deg C. Then, the Ni based multilayer thin films started to absorb H2 gas. Amount of absorbed H2 gas can be evaluated by the pressure measurement of the chamber. Typically, after about 50,000 s, H2 gas was evacuated and simultaneously the samples were heated up by the ceramic heater up to 500–900 deg C. The evacuation and heating process seem to trigger heat generation reactions. Heat burst phenomena were simultaneously detected by a radiation thermometer looking at the surface of the multilayer thin film and a thermocouple located near the metal composite. It shows that heat measurement by the thermocouple embedded in the ceramic heater correctly reflects surface temperature detected by the radiation thermometer. Excess energy generation using nano-sized multilayer Cu/Ni metal composite and Cu/Ni metal with third material (CaO, Y2O3) composite were presented. Maximum released excess energy reached 1.1 MJ and average released energy per absorbed total hydrogen was 16 keV/H or 1.5 GJ/H-mol. It cannot be explained by any known chemical process and suggests that the observed heat generation must be of nuclear origin. Various analysis methods, such as SEM-EDX or TOF-SIMS, had been applied to obtain information about what kind of reactions occur by the interaction of the nano-sized multilayer metal composite with hydrogen gas.",,,,,,

"The field of condensed matter nuclear science originated in 1989 with Fleischmann and Pons’ electrolysis of Pd with heavy water. However, anomalous heat generation and other related phenomena were observed not only by electrochemical methods, but also by loading of deuterium or hydrogen in metals such as Pd and Ni. In this paper, we will first give a short overview of the progress in these gas loading type experiments. After that, we will describe the recent progress of our research team. The authors have been studying energy generation using nano-sized multilayer metal composites with hydrogen gas. Two nano-sized metal multilayer composite samples, which were composed of Ni, Cu, and other thin films on bulk Ni (25 mm × 25 mm × 0.1 mm), were used. These samples were fabricated by the Ar ion beam method, or by the magnetron sputtering method. Heat bursts and excess energy generation were observed during the experiments under vacuum conditions (<10^-4 Pa) using nano-sized metal multilayer composites on Ni substrate and hydrogen gas. Released energy normalized to the total amount of absorbed hydrogen reached 16 keV/H or 1.5 GJ/H-mol. Sometimes spontaneous heat bursts were observed. This suggests that the burst heat release reactions occurred in the near surface region of the nano-sized multilayer metal composite. Furthermore, we have succeeded in intentionally inducing heat bursts, based on the observations of the spontaneous heat bursts. By measuring the optical spectrum emitted from the sample, we detected a simultaneous increase in mid infrared radiation flux when a heat burst occurred.",,,,,,

"Experiments were initiated at Trombay during the first week of April 1989 to verify the widely reported claims of the occurrence of cold fusion. A large burst of ≈ 2 × 10^7 neutrons was first detected on April 21st with a Pd-Ni electrolytic cell. The neutron counting rate, averaged over a 5 minute interval, was a couple of orders of magnitude larger than that of background count rates. In this experiment the tritium level in the D2O electrolyte jumped from the initial stock solution value of 2.6 Bq/ml to a 5.6 × 10^4 Bq/ml, an increase by over four orders of magnitude. The total quantity of tritium generated corresponds to ≈ 10^16 atoms suggesting a neutron to tritium channel branching ratio of less than 10^-8 in cold fusion. Significant quantities of neutrons and tritium were also observed to be produced in gas loaded Ti and Pd samples. Autoradiography of D2 loaded Ti disc targets have shown a number of hot spots indicating uneven distribution of tritium production in the near-surface region. On the whole the Trombay experiments have unequivocally confirmed the occurrence of cold fusion reactions both in Pd and Ti metallic lattices loaded with deuterium.",,,,,,

"A wide variety of experiments have been carried out by twelve independent teams employing both electrolytic and gas phase loading of deuterium in Pd and Ti metals to investigate the phenomenon of cold fusion first reported by Fleischmann and Pons in March 1989. The experiments were primarily devoted to the study of the emission of nuclear particles such as neutrons and tritium with a view to verify the ""nuclear origin"" of cold fusion. In 22 different electrolytic experiments whose cathode surface areas ranged from 0.1 to 300 cm^2, large bursts of neutrons and/or tritium were measured. Some of these gave clear evidence that these two nuclear particles were being generated simultaneously. The neutron-to-tritium yield ratios in the majority of these experiments was in the range of 10^-6 to 10^-9. The specific neutron and tritium yields expressed per cm^2 of cathode surface area also fitted into a systematic pattern. A unique feature of the BARC electrolysis results is that the first bursts of neutrons and tritium occurred (in 8 out of 11 cells) on the very first day of commencement of electrolysis, when hardly a few amp-hrs of charge had been passed.",,,,,,

"We consider a recently proposed mechanism for low energy nuclear reactions (LENRs). In this mechanism the process is initiated by an external photon whose contribution is treated perturbatively. In the present paper we consider a related process that is induced by photon emission rather than absorption. We consider, as an example, fusion of hydrogen and deuterium to form He(3). This process, at leading order, proceeds by emission of a photon. In the present case we consider two photon emission and hence we need to go to the second order in perturbation theory. The emission of a high energy photon from the initial D-H system leads to the formation of an intermediate state which is a superposition of all energy eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian. We compute the cross section for such a reaction and show that, for suitable conditions in condensed matter medium, the reaction rate can be sufficiently large to be observable..",,,,,,

"We propose a new mechanism for inducing low energy nuclear reactions (LENRs). The process is initiated by an electromagnetic perturbation. The initial two body nuclear state emits a photon and forms an intermediate state which makes a transition into the final nuclear state with the emission of another photon. We need to sum over all energies of the intermediate state. Since the energy of this state is unconstrained, we get contributions from very high energies for which the barrier penetration factor is not necessarily small. By considering fusion of 1H and 2H to form 3He, we determine the conditions under which this mechanism leads to fusion at observable rates. We show that this mechanism works only inside a medium and not in free space. We show that a clear experimental signature of this process is emission of two photons in coincidence whose total energy is related to the Q value of this process. Hence this process can be confirmed or ruled by the presence or absence of such photons in the final state.",,,,,,

"Researchers have long been puzzled about the basic nuclear reaction mechanisms of low-energy nuclear reactions (LENR). Usually the crystal lattice or nano-particles (among others) are assumed to be the nuclear active environment that catalyzes the reaction somehow. In contrast, the author has built a quantum-mechanical model of the nuclear active environment in LENR, where this environment is modeled as an ultra-dense plasmoid, i.e. a ""condensed plasmoid"" (CP). The computed properties of CPs are so exotic that CPs qualify as a previously unknown aggregation state of matter. The quantum-mechanical model of CPs is based on the cylindrical symmetry of a very thin (i.e. about 40 pm) plasma ""wire"". (The quantitative properties given in the abstract depend on the configuration of the CP; these are just examples.) The electrons of a CP are fully delocalized and decoupled from the nuclei. They are moving with high velocity (10–80% of light speed) against the nuclei. This results in an intrinsic current of about 9 kA in the CP with a mean current density of approximately 2.5 A/pm2. The magnetic field from this current reaches 50 MT (magatesla) and creates a confinement pressure of more than 1021 Pa. The electrons are compressed by the strong z-pinch condition to a mean density of about 0.15 electrons/pm3. The creation of a CP is an endothermic process (i.e. it takes in energy from an external source), which typically requires discharges with high voltages and high currents. Once created, these objects can be long-living (lasting hours). The minimum distance of hydrogen nuclei in a CP is only about 2 pm, which enables tunneling of nuclei through the Coulomb barrier, i.e. nuclear fusion. The barrier is also much screened by the dense electrons.",,,,,,

"Mantle helium and other volatiles may be released to volcanic crater lakes. This paper presents the observation of 3H and mantle helium in the crater Lakes Nemrut (Turkey), Laacher (Germany) and Pavin (France). The presence of excess 3H in the lakes can be explained as material released from mantle sources because of the correlation of excess 3H with mantle 3He and 4He. The helium concentration was much higher in the bottom layers of the lakes. The 4He and 3He concentrations in Lakes Nemrut, Laacher, and Pavin were determined to be 25 and 190; 10 and 50; and 70 and 500 times larger than the atmospheric saturation value, respectively. The isotopic ratio of the excess helium, 3Heex/4Heex, in Lakes Nemrut, Laacher and Pavin was (1.032±0.006)×10^-5, (7.42±0.03)×10^-6 and (9.09±0.01)×10^6 respectively. The ratios clearly indicate that large amounts of helium isotopes are released to the lakes from a mantle source. The excess 3H at the bottom of Lakes Nemrut, Laacher and Pavin is estimated to be 3.7±1.4 TU, ~1.4 TU and ~4 TU respectively. Detection of tritium in the Earth’s interior is key evidence for natural nuclear fusion in the Earth.",,,,,,

"We have suggested that the mantle 3He and 3H might have originated from natural nuclear fusion (d-d and d-p reaction, or other reactions) in deep Earth. Encouraged by this new idea, we tried to recreate nuclear fusion at low temperature in the laboratory. This paper describes charged particles emitted from the deuterium-loaded titanium foil and powder at low temperature. Although the counts are very low (about 0.13 counts/h), fortunately, broad and narrow peaks are observed for the deuterium-loaded titanium foil and TiD-Mo sample respectively. The charged particle is identified as proton having energy of about 2.8 MeV after exiting the sample. We suggest that the proton might originate from d‑d reaction in the samples. Then the d-d reaction rate is calculated to be 1.4 × 10^-24 fusion/d-d·sec for the deuterium-loaded titanium foil sample. On the other hand, no charged particles were observed above the background level for deuterium-loaded titanium powder sample. Therefore, this work provides a positive result of nuclear fusion for the metal foil samples, but a negative result for the powder samples. The negative result of the deuterium-loaded titanium powder sample suggests that the reaction yield might be correlated with deuterium density, or it may be correlated with microscopic variations in the deuterium-loaded titanium materials. The negative result also indicates that d-d reaction catalyzed by µ-meson from cosmic ray can be excluded in this experiment. The present work may be helpful to the further study on the physical mechanism of nuclear fusion in deuterium (hydrogen)-loaded metals and also helpful to the study of origin of 3He in the deep Earth.",,,,,,

The number of neutron in the large bursts was measured up to 2800 in less than 64-Ã‚Âµs interval. After accidental artifact noise and cosmic-ray source are ruled out, we suggest that the anomalous cascade neutron bursts are correlated with deuterium-loaded metals and probably is the result of nuclear reaction occurring in the samples.",,,,,,

Intense bursts of charged particles far Larger than background have been reproducibly detected for the first time by using CR-39 solid state nuclear track detector during either a high voltage discharge between deuterated palladium electrodes or a non-equilibrium out-diffusion of deuterons in palladium. No any anomalous effects were found in the controL experiments of Pd-H system under the same experimental conditions. This indicates that some anomalous nu clear effects were definately produced in the Pd-D system under certain conditions.,,,,,,

"What should a scientist do with an anomalous experimental result (one which flies in the face of prevailing theories), which is statistically significant (at the five sigma + level), yet which cannot be repeated at will? This is the problem which plagued us early on in our non-plasma or ""cold"" fusion experiments which began in spring 1986 at Brigham Young University, 2.5 years before we heard of the ostensibly-related work of Drs. Pons and Fleischmann. It is a question which haunts us still. I invite the reader to seriously consider the question posed above: what would you do with such data? If you walk away from an anomalous result, you could miss something important. Indeed, is it scientifically honest to ignore such data? One can argue that scientific instruments often show ""glitches,"" and this is probably just one of these . . .",,,,,,

"Abstract We present evidence for energetic charged particles emanating from partially-deuterided titanium foils (TiDx) subjected to non-equilibrium conditions. To scrutinize emerging evidence for low-temperature nuclear reactions, we investigated particle yields employing three independent types of highly-sensitive, segmented particle detectors over a six-year period. One experiment measuring neutron emission from TiDx foils showed a background-subtracted yield of 57 ± 13 counts per hour. (The neutron experiments will be discussed in a separate paper.) A second experiment, using a photo-multiplier tube with plastic and glass scintillators and TiDx registered charged particle emissions at 2,171 ± 93 counts/hour, over 400 times the background rate. Moreover, these particles were identified as protons having 2.6 MeV after ex-iting the TiDx foil array. In a third experiment, coincident charged particles consistent with protons and tritons were observed with high reproducibility in two energy-dispersive ion-implanted detectors located on either side of 25-micron thick Ti foils loaded with deuterium. Our overall data therefore strongly sug-gest low-level nuclear fusion in deuterided metals under these conditions according to the fusion reactions d + d ? n(2.45 MeV) + 3He(0.82 MeV) and d + d ? p(3.02 MeV) + t(1.01 MeV), with other nuclear reactions being possible also. Important advances were particle identifications, and repeatability exceed-ing 70% for coincident charged particle emissions. Metal processing and establishing non-equilibrium conditions appear to be important keys to achieving significant nuclear-particle yields and repeatability.",,,,,,

"An examination has been made of the heat production at ten palladium electrodes, each prepared in a different way. Seven of these produced heat during D2 evolution in a D2 -O2 electrolysis cell (no recombination attempted) which coincided precisely with the prediction of classical electrochemical theory, and thus eliminated the suspicion of heat through unintended D2 -O2 recombination. Three electrodes clearly produced an excess heat of ~2-5 watts-cm^-3. The heat was observed for periods of 10-33 hrs. In one electrode the excess heat production ""shut off"" (after 33 hrs) with no apparent cause: it did not return in five days of further electrolysis.",,,,,,

"This paper presents a theoretical discussion of a new phenomenon, called the `cooperative internal conversion process', in which the coupling of bound-free electron and neutron (or proton) transitions due to the dipole term of their Coulomb interaction, which permits cooperation of two nuclei leading to neutron (or proton) exchange if that is allowed by energy conservation. General expressions of the cross section of the processes are reported in the case of one particle nuclear and spherical shell models as well as in the case of free atoms (e.g. noble gases). A half-life characteristic of the process is also determined. As numerical examples, the cooperative internal conversion process by neutron exchange in Ne and by proton exchange in Al are dealt with. The processes may have significance in fields of nuclear waste disposal and nuclear energy production. As a generalization, cooperative internal conversion process by heavy charged particle exchange is discussed, and as an example of it, the cooperative internal conversion process by triton exchange is also discussed.",,,,,,

"Low energy nuclear processes, which are strongly hindered by Coulomb repulsion between the reacting nuclei, are investigated in solid environment. It is shown that this hindering effect may be essentially weakened (it practically disappears) if one takes into account the Coulomb interaction of one of the reacting particles with the surroundings. It is obtained that if the modification of the wave function due to Coulomb interaction with charged constituents of the environment is taken into account applying standard perturbation calculation of quantum mechanics then waves of high momentum with small amplitude are mixed to the initial wave of small momentum. This may be interpreted as the slow, quasi-free heavy particle of positive charge pushes a heavy particle of the environment and they can obtain (virtually) such a great magnitude of momentum (of opposite direction) in the intermediate state in that the probability of nuclear reaction with another positively charged, slow, heavy particle significantly increases. This magnitude of (virtual) momentum is determined by energy and momentum conservation between initial and final states. The mechanism (called recoil assistance) opens the door to a great variety of nuclear processes that are now thought to have negligible rate at low energies. The recoil assisted nuclear $pd$ reaction is investigated like a sample reaction numerically. A partial overview of low energy nuclear reactions allowed by recoil assistance and leading to nuclear transmutations is presented. A critical analysis of Fleischmann-Pons type low energy nuclear reaction experiments is also presented.",,,,,,

"This paper reviews a theoretical program to understand the field of low energy nuclear reactions (LENR), initially called cold fusion, which was a puzzle of the last three decades. A series of concepts, which were raised and partly elaborated, are presented. The key concept is a three-body mechanism, where one of the nuclei serves as a catalyst for the reaction of the other two. In these reactions, a single fusion product or two outgoing nuclei are created, along with the recoiled catalytic nucleus. They carry off the nuclear energy released, and heat the surrounding materials by multiple collisions. Importantly, they produce high energy ! radiation with negligible probability. So, this three-body idea solves the two major riddles of LENR, that nuclear reactions can occur at ordinary temperatures and without emitting ! radiation. Cross sections and rates are calculated using standard quantum mechanics, and accepted nuclear and solid-state physics. Their dependence on relevant densities, and on the reacting and catalytic nuclei, are explicit. The theoretical ideas and the results of their elaboration are compared with diverse data from LENR experiments with considerable success.",,,,,,

New results for glow discharge in deuterium calorimetry are presented. In separate experiments a heat output five times exceeding the input electric power was observed. The result for the charged particle spectrum measurement is presented. Charged particles with energies up to 18 MeV and an average energy of 2-4 MeV were seen. Beams of gamma-rays with energies of about 200 keV and a characteristic X-ray radiation were registered. The summed energy of the registered products is three orders short of the values needed to explain the calorimetric results.,,,,,,

ABSTRACT X-ray emission with energy of 1.5 - 2 keV and intensity up to 100 R\sec was registered in the experiments with the high-current glow discharge in deuterium and hydrogen for cathodes made of Pd and other metals. The presence of two x-ray components: diffusion x-ray emission and x-ray emission in the form of laser beams were established by experiments. The laser x-ray emission was registered some msec later after turning off the current. The continuous mode of generating a laser x-ray beam with the diameter of 9mm and power of up to 10 W at the efficiency coefficient of electrical discharge power conversion into the x-ray laser emission up to 20% was obtained in some experiments.,,,,,,

"Experimental data from low energy nuclear reactions (LERN) in condensed media are presented. The nuclear reactions products were found in solid cathode media used in glow discharge. Apparently, the nuclear reactions were initiated when bombarding the cathode surface by plasma ions with the energy of 1.0-2.0 keV. Excess heat from a high current glow discharge reaction in D2 , Xe and Kr using cathodes already charged with preliminary deuterium-charged Pd and Ti cathode samples are given. Excess heat up to 10 - 15 W and efficiency up to 130% was recorded under the experiments for Pd cathode samples in D2 discharge. Excess heat up to 5 W and efficiency up to 150% was recorded for Pd cathodes that were charged with deuterium before the run, in Xe and Kr discharges. At the same time excess heat was not observed for pure Pd cathode samples in Xe and Kr discharges. The formation of impurity nuclides (7Li, 13C, 15N, 20Ne, 29Si, 44Ca, 48Ca, 56Fe, 57Fe, 59Co, 64Zn, 66Zn, 75As, 107Ag, 109Ag, 110Cg, 111Cg, 112Cg, 114Cg, 115In) with the efficiency up to 1013 atoms/s was recorded. The isotopic ratios of these new nuclides was quite different from the natural ratios. Soft X-ray radiation from the solid-state cathode with the intensity up to 0.01Gy/s was recorded in experiments with discharges in H2, D2 , Ar, Xe and Kr. The X-ray radiation was observed in bursts of up to 106 photons, with up to 105 bursts per second while the discharge was formed and within 100 ms after turning off the discharge current. The results of the X-ray radiation registration showed that the exited energy levels have a lifetime up to 100 ms or more, and the energy of 1.2 - 2.5 keV. A possible mechanism for producing excess heat and nuclear transmutation reactions in the solid medium with the exited energy levels is considered..",,,,,,

The concept of this investigation is based on phenomenon of interaction between deuterium and hydrogen ions, on one hand, and the solid medium (of Pd, Ti and other materials), on the other hand. The said interaction was studied in experiments with electrolysis, electric gas discharge and gas diffusion. At present a huge collection of stable 100%-reproduced results on Excess Heat power production has been accumulated. In most experiments the correlation of the relative output Excess Heat power to the input (electric) power does not exceed 10-20%. This scientific approach is now well recognized by the leading groups of researchers and scientific associations (such as the American Physical Society, the American Nuclear Society, the Los Alamos US National Laboratory, the US Livermore Lawrence National Laboratory and others.) despite the lack of widely familiar theoretical instrument for the description of the physical phenomena in question.",,,,,,

"We have observed X-ray emission from metal cathodes in high-current (up to 500 mA) glow discharge experiments in the spectral range from 600 eV to 6 keV. The effect has been seen with a variety of different metal cathodes (including Al, Sc, Ti, V, Ni, Nb, Zr, Mo, Pd, Ta, W, and Pt), as well as with different gasses (including D2, H2, Kr, Ar, and Xe) at low pressure (10 torr). We have observed both diffuse and collimated X-ray emission. Diffuse emission occurs in bursts of X-rays; with up to 105 bursts per second, with up to 106 photons per burst. Collimated X-ray emission appears in the form of beamlets directed normal to the cathodes surface with a very small angular divergence; with up to 104 bursts per second, and up to 1013 photons overall. Switching off the glow discharge current produces substantial X-ray bursts in these experiments; and we see some bursts during the discharge, and up to 20 h after switch off. We present results from a variety of diagnostics, including: pinhole camera imaging; thermo-luminescent detector measurements; time-resolved scintillator measurements; and a curved mica spectrometer to register X-ray spectra. The spectra of the collimated X-rays shows a strong broad emission feature that is centered near 1.5 keV in many experiments. Line emission is sometimes observed in addition along with the broad feature.",,,,,,

The experiments were carried out using a high-current glow discharge device, which consisted of a water-cooling chamber, water-cooling cathode and anode units. X-ray emission was detected through a diagnostic window placed above the cathode. The discharge was performed in H2, D2, Ar, Kr and Xe at pressure ranging from 1 to 5 Torr, using cathode samples made of Al, Sc, V, Ti, Ni, Zr, Nb, Mo, Pd, Ta, and W. Current ranged from 50 up to 300 mA and discharge voltage was 1500-4300 V. A pulse-periodical power supply was used to generate the glow discharge. The X-ray spectrum were registered both as bands of the continuum with energies ranging 0.6-10.0 keV and as spots resulting from the emission of series of high-density monoenergetic X-ray beams (with energies of 0.6-10.0 keV) characterized by small angular divergence. The X-ray spectra were repeatedly recorded during the Glow Discharge operation and after the Glow Discharge current switch off (for up to 20 h afterwards).

"D+D reactions in various metals were investigated for the deuteron bombardment with bombarding energies at around 150 keV and below 15 keV. Energetic protons and α-particles which can never be attained in the D+D reaction were observed in bombardments with higher energy deuterons. In order to explain the spectra, reaction processes in which three deuterons are involved are considered; sequential reaction and simultaneous three-body reaction. The sequential reaction can well explain the observed bump structure, and the three-body reaction can reproduce the continuum spectral shape of protons and α-particles, although an anomalously large enhancement factor is required. For the lower energy bombardment, thick target yields for the D+D reactions in Ti were measured down to 4.7 keV. They were well explained with the astrophysical S-factors deduced from gas target measurements. This indicates that the effect of the environment is not so much different for the deuterons in Ti and in gas phase.",,,,,,

Abstract Yields of protons emitted in the D + D reaction in Pd and PdO thick targets were measured for bombarding energies between 2.5 and 10 keV. The obtained yields were compared with those predicted by using the parameterization of cross sections at higher energies. It was found that both of the yields for Pd and PdO are surprisingly larger than the prediction. The bombarding energy dependence of the yields are well described with screening potential parameters; Ue = 250 eV for Pd and 600 eV for PdO. The significance of a simple extrapolation of the observed enhancement is discussed.,,,,,,

Protons and α particles were observed with energies up to ~17 and ~6.5 MeV, respectively, which can never be attained in the D+D reaction. A bump structure at around 14 MeV seen in the proton spectrum can be well explained as emitted in the sequential reaction involving three deuterons. However, protons and α particles distributed continuously up to the maximum energies can never be understood as products of the conceivable nuclear reactions.",,,,,,

It was found that the reaction rate at lower energies varies greatly with the host materials. The most strongly enhanced DD reaction occurs in PdO. At Ed = 2.5 keV, it is enhanced by factor of fifty from the bare deuteron rate and the screening energy deduced from the excitation function amounts to 600 eV.

"The DD fusion reactions in various materials have been studied, and enhancements in the rate of the D(d,p)T fusion reaction over the Gamow function were clearly seen in the materials. Of particular interest is the fact that the reaction rate of the D+D reactions at 2.5 keV in PdO is 60 times (and in Pd 10 times) larger than in Ti, and the deduced screening energy amounts to 600 eV (300 eV). Furthermore, the subsequent study on the Li+d reactions showed large screening energy as 1.7 keV, again, in Pd metal. These cannot be explained by bound-electron screening which may give at most an energy of 20 eV for the DD reaction and of 0.3 keV for the Li+d reaction, but suggests the existence of an additional, and important, mechanism. Perhaps there is a fluidity of deuterons in metals that also reduces the Coulomb barrier between the fusing nulcei.",,,,,,

"Screening for nuclear reactions in metal plays an important role in enhancing reaction cross sections in the ultra-low energy region. A simple extrapolation of the screening potential down to the thermal energy region from the keV beam experiment predicts the occurrence of ""cold fusion"" D+D reactions. In the present work, results so far obtained in low-energy beam experiments will be overviewed and the origin of the screening potential will be discussed: both electronic screening and ionic screening. For ionic screening we have studied nuclear reactions in liquid metal which can be regarded as a low-temperature dense plasma. In such a condition, the classical ions contribute to the screening more strongly than the quantum electrons do. Results on the 7Li+p and 6Li+d reactions with liquid Li target will be shown. The effects of the solid-liquid phase transition are clearly seen in these reactions. It can be concluded that the ionic Debye screening is much stronger than the electronic screening in low-temperature dense plasmas.",,,,,,

"We have measured protons and tritons from the d (d,p) t reaction in liquid In, Sn, Pb and Bi during the D+3 molecular deuterium beam bombardment for 15 < E < 60 keV. Observed energy spectra and yield excitation functions are anomalous and suggest that the target deuteron is also in motion. It is found that the reaction mechanism is unique to the molecular beam in such a way that one deuteron in a molecule is elastically scattered by a host metal atom and then it collides with the other to cause the d+d reaction. We call it as the cooperative colliding mechanism (CCM). Experimental data are compared with the CCM calculation and values of the screening energy of the d+d reaction are deduced. They are 380  80, 570  80, 670  100 and 490  100 eV for In, Sn, Pb and Bi, respectively. It is concluded that the screening energy of the d+d reaction in an electron plasma in metal is really large: the averaged value of 530 eV is more than ten times larger than the simple Thomas–Fermi screening prediction.",,,,,,

"We present evidence for energetic charged particles emanating from partially deuterided titanium foils (TiDx) subjected to non-equilibrium conditions. To scrutinize emerging evidence for low-temperature nuclear reactions, we investigated particle yields employing three independent types of highly-sensitive, segmented particle detectors over a six-year period. One experiment measuring neutron emission from TiDx foils showed a background-subtracted yield of 57 ± 13 counts per hour. (The neutron experiments are discussed in a separate paper in this proceedings.) A second experiment, using a photo-multiplier tube with plastic and glass scintillators and TiDx registered charged particle emissions at 2,171 ± 93 counts/hour, over 400 times the background rate. Moreover, these particles were identified as protons having 2.6 MeV after exiting the TiDx foil array. In a third experiment, coincident charged particles consistent with protons and tritons were observed with high reproducibility in two energy-dispersive ion-implanted detectors located on either side of 25-micron thick Ti foils loaded with deuterium.",,,,,,

"Evidence is presented for neutrons emanating from partially deuterated titanium foils (TiDx) subjected to non-equilibrium conditions (charged particle results appear in a separate paper in this proceedings). Two types of deuteriding and varied currents were employed to produce the non-equilibrium conditions within the foils, and emissions lasted over long durations. Experiments were conducted in a deep underground tunnel having significant rock overburden to diminish cosmic backgrounds. Subtracting background rates and taking into account detector efficiency, we found the highest net yield to be 57 ± 13 counts/hour. Yields for all runs are reported and the theoretical fusion reaction defined. Totaling all experiments, reproducibility was 40%.",,,,,,

"Simple pressurization of nanosized palladium with deuterium appears to be a simpler and more rapid method to generate anomalous heat compared to electrolytic systems. A survey of the literature indicates that palladium particles less than 2 nm in size can obtain a Pd/D loading near one at modest deuterium pressure. In hundreds of reactions, we have routinely prepared palladium nanoparticles inside an aluminosilicate matrix and have found that these systems produce up to 8 fold more heat with deuterium compared to hydrogen. Furthermore, a characteristic signature of a pressurization reaction is its reversibility -- the heat released upon pressurization should be absorbed upon evacuation. This reversibility is observed with hydrogen but not deuterium. Although we are still seeking conventional explanations for this excess heat, the anomalous heat does not appear to be explained by impurities in the deuterium gas nor other simple chemical or physical sources. The selection and preparation of the particles, the experimental set-up, and results will be discussed.",,,,,,

"Gas loading of palladium particles <2 nm in size produces anomalous amounts of heat in a reproducible manner. This heat is produced in the presence of deuterium but not in the presence of hydrogen. Control experiments have ruled out the excess heat was due to impurities in the deuterium that were absent in the hydrogen. Because the system is simple and mostly reversible, all extra heat must be of chemical or some other origin. Neither radiation nor nuclear ""ash"" was found to correlate with the anomalous heat. In some matrices, the likely source of the anomalous heat is D-H exchange with the water present in the matrix, where an approximate third increase of the expected energy from calculations can account for most of the excess heat. In other matrices, no simple explanation of the excess heat can be made.",,,,,,

"Prior gas loading experiments of Zirconium-Nickel-Palladium alloys have been reported to generate a greater amount of heat with deuterium than with hydrogen. What is intriguing about these experiments was the long-term heat observed. Others, using commercial materials of similar composition, have been unable to observe long-term heat. We also have been unable to observe long-term heat in the commercial materials and materials prepared at NRL. Furthermore, when tested using our gas-loading protocol of measuring both the heat during pressurization and evacuation, these alloys do not show much, if any, excess heat and the majority of the heat observed can be attributed to chemistry.",,,,,,

A general expression is given for the modified Coulomb barrier penetration factor which includes the lepton screening effect and which can be used for extrapolating the fusion cross sections to lower energies. It is shown that, when combined with the effect of velocity distribution in the context of the surface reaction mechanism, the electron screening effect may explain the claimed results of recent electrolysis fusion experiments and may also explain why it is difficult to reproduce the same result with different samples in electrolysis experiments. Experimental tests of the effects of electron and muon screening are suggested both for electrolysis experiments and for inelastic scattering experiments.",,,,,,

Recent highly reproducible results of tritium production by deuterium-deuterium (D-D) fusion from gas/solid-state fusion experiments are discussed in terms of a surface fusion mechanism. Theoretical criteria and experimental conditions for improving and optimizing D-D fusion rates in a gas/solid-state fusion device are described. It is shown that the surface fusion mechanism also provides a plausible explanation for the nonreproducibility of the results of electrolysis fusion experiments.,,,,,,

"Based on the optical theorem formulation of low-energy nuclear reactions, we show that a Gamow factor cancellation can occur for nuclear fusion reactions if the imaginary part of the effective nuclear interaction in the elastic channel has a small component of a finite longrange interaction. It is recently shown that a near cancellation of the Gamow factor at low energies can occur if one of the final-state nuclei has a weakly bound (""halo"") excited state. Another mechanism for the Gamow factor cancellation is a continuum-electron shielding of nuclear charge by a dense electron plasma. If the Gamow factor cancellation occurs, it can lead to a large enhancement of reaction rates and probabilities for low-energy nuclear fusion reaction and nuclear fission, and may provide nuclear physics mechanisms for explaining the anomalous effects observed in low-energy nuclear reactions. Several specific cases of the anomalous effects are discussed in terms of nuclear physics mechanisms, including cluster-impact nuclear reactions which may be relevant to the low-energy nuclear transmutation.",,,,,,

To do this in a reproducible faction, a pre-and post-run analysis of the films was carried out using various probe techniques. In this study, various Pd-Ni thin films were manufactured using with a magnetron sputtering method. A variety of methods for pre-conditioning of substrates were experimented with. The samples were also treated by different annealing methods using inert gas and vacuum annealing processes. The investigations of samples were performed in an UHV system equipped with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). It is shown that the vacuum annealed samples provided the best films. This suggests that vacuum annealing can pull bubbles from pores in the thin film, giving a higher density thin film that performs better.

"There have been a number of reports of observation of nuclear fusion events in acoustic cavitation experiments with deuterated liquid. Some of the reported results have been interpreted as a result of achieving thermonuclear fusion temperatures (~a few keV) during acoustic bubble cavitation (ABC). We propose an alternative theoretical model for the ABC fusion based on Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) mechanism. Our theoretical model yields two main predictions. The first prediction is that the Coulomb interaction between two charged bosons is suppressed for the case in which number N of charged bosons is large, and hence the conventional Gamow factor is absent. The second prediction is that the fusion rate depends on the probability of the BEC ground state occupation instead of the conventional Gamow factor. This implies that the fusion rate will increase as the temperature of the system is lowered since the probability of the BEC state is larger at lower temperatures. These predictions imply that the ABC fusion may be achievable at lower temperatures. A number of key improvement to acoustic cavitation experiments are proposed to check these predictions as well as the results of other experiments.",,,,,,

"We report preliminary results of experimental test of the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) mechanism for ultra low energy nuclear fusion in nano-scale atomic clusters at pressures up to a 20,000 psi and at both room temperature and liquid nitrogen temperatures. Bose-Einstein condensation of integer-spin nuclei was suggested as a possible mechanism for ultra low-energy nuclear reaction in 1998. Recently, theoretical studies of the BEC mechanism have been carried out by solving approximately many-body Schroedinger equation for a system of N identical charged integer-spin nuclei (""Bose"" nuclei) confined in ion traps. The solution is used to obtain theoretical formulae for estimating the probabilities and rates of nuclear fusion for N identical Bose nuclei confined in an ion trap or an atomic cluster. These formulae show that the fusion rate does not depend on the Coulomb barrier penetration probability but instead depends on the probability of the ground-state occupation, which is expected to increase as the temperature decreases. To test these theoretical predictions, a series of experiments have been devised and performed. The preliminary results of these experiments and also plans of future experiments are described.",,,,,,

"Abstract Most of experimental results of low energy nuclear reaction (LENR) reported so far cannot be reproduced on demand. There have been persistent experimental results indicating that the LENR and transmutation processes in condensed matters (LENRTPCM) are surface phenomena rather than bulk phenomena. Recently proposed Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) mechanism may provide a suitable theoretical description of the surface phenomena. New experiments are proposed and described for testing the BEC mechanism for LENR and transmutation processses in micro-scale and nano-scale traps. (1) We propose the use of micro- or nano-porous conducting materials as a cathode in electrolysis experiments with heavy water with or without Li in order to stabilize the active surface spots and to enhance the effect for the purpose of improving the reproducibility of excess heat generation and nuclear emission. (2) We propose new experiemental tests of the BEC mechanism by measuring the presssure and temperaure dependence of LENR events using deuterium gas and these deuterated metals with or without Li. If the LENRTPCM are surface phenomena, the proposed use of micro/nano scale porous materials is expected to enhance and scale up the LENRTPCM effects by many order of magnitude, and thus may lead to better reproductivity and theoretical understanding of the phenomena.",,,,,,

"Abstract Recently, a generalization of the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) mechanism has been made to a ground-state mixture of two different species of positively charged bosons in harmonic traps. The theory has been used to describe (D + Li) reactions in the low energy nuclear reaction (LENR) processes in condensed matter and predicts that the (D + Li) reaction rates can be larger than (D + D) reaction rates by as much as a factor of ~50, implying that (D + Li) reactions may be occuring in addition to the (D + D) reactions. A survey of the existing data from LENR experiments is carried out to check the validity of the theoretical prediction. We conclude that there is compelling experimental evidence which support the theoretical prediction. New experimental tests of the theoretical prediction are suggested.",,,,,,

Application of this result is discussed for the generalization of the Bose-Einstein condensation mechanism for low-energy nuclear reaction (LENR) and transmutation processes in condensed matters.

The most basic theoretical challenge for understanding low energy nuclear reaction (LENR) and transmutation reaction (LETR) in condensed matters is to find mechanisms by which the large Coulomb barrier between fusing nuclei can be overcome. A unifying theory of LENR and LETR has been developed to provide possible mechanisms for the LENR and LETR processes in matters based on high-density nano-scale and micro-scale quantum plasmas. It is shown that recently developed theoretical models based on Bose-Einstein Fusion (BEF) mechanism and Quantum Plasma Nuclear Fusion (QPNF) mechanism are applicable to the results of many different types of LENR and LETR experiments,,,,,,

"For calculations of probability of nuclear reactions of hydrogen isotopes in the crystal lattice of titanium deuteride the model offered earlier for palladium deuteride was used. In a series of experiments the probability of D-D approach for random initial conditions was calculated, when initial energies of approaching deuterons were set in the range of energies 0.01-0.51 eV. For each experimental value of D-D approach the reaction rate was calculated on the shifted Coulomb potential with the shift energy, which equals to the energy of screening. The mean distance of D-D approach on all series equals 0.97 angstroms, that exceeds the mean distance in a molecule D-D. However, more than 14% of all experimental values show an approach of deuterons for a distance less than 0.1 angstroms. The general reaction rate for the given set of the initial conditions will make 10^1.91 DD^-1 s^-1. It is 4 orders of magnitude less, than the analogous rate calculated earlier for palladium deuteride. For optimization of calculations the most favorable initial conditions were selected. As a result the rate of the reaction calculated according to the above model should be additionally multiplied by a correction factor, which allows for the probability of the occurrence of these favorable conditions. In our case it equals 10^-16 - 10^-18; the rate of the nuclear fusion reaction of deuterons in titanium deuteride should be 3-4 orders lower, than the earlier calculated rate for palladium deuteride and equals 10^-14 - 10*-16 DD^-1 s^-1.",,,,,,

"The dynamic model of electron orbitals deformation (EODD) was previously devised for palladium deuteride. It has now been applied to calculate the probability of nuclear reactions of hydrogen isotopes in the crystal lattice of lanthanum deuteride. In a series of computer simulations, the probability of D-D approach for random initial conditions was calculated, when the initial energies of the approaching deuterons were set in the range of 0.001-9.0 eV. For each experimental value of D-D approach the reaction rate was calculated on the shifted Coulomb potential with the shift energy, which equals to the energy of screening. The mean distance of D-D approach on the whole series equals 0.19 Å. More than 54% of all experimental values show an approach of deuterons for a distance less than 0.1 Å. The average reaction rate for the given set of the initial conditions is 10^3.28 DD^-1 s^-1. This is three orders of magnitude less than the analogous rate calculated earlier for palladium deuteride. Allowing for the higher D content and the higher number of adjacent tetrahedral sites in LaD3 as compared with PdD0,6, an overall nuclear fusion rate in lanthanum deuteride will be only slight lower than in palladium deuteride, that is, 10^-12 - 10^-14 DD^-1 s^-1.",,,,,,

The beam-target D(d,p)t reaction yield during the implantation is found dependent on the beam current or the deuterium flux. This is interpreted in terms of a temperature dependence of the deuterium concentration that is measured in situ with the ERD method. When both surfaces of the Pd sample are coated with 7.5-Ã‚Âµm thick films of aluminum oxide, the reaction yield is observed to increase by a factor of about 5, and the ERD spectra show distributions of D more localized near the surface.",,,,,,

Pd powder, the Pd-black, and the mixed oxides of Pd·Zr, Pd·Ni·Zr and Ni·Zr. It has been found that the D(H)/Pd loading ratio and the absorption energy per D (H) is an increasing function of fineness of the sample surface. The Pd·Zr oxide nano-composites showed anomalously large energies of hydrogen isotope absorption as well as large loading ratio in the phase of deuteride/hydride formation. Although the samples were deteriorated by the repeated baking-hydrogenation cycles, an artificial oxidation of the PZ and the PNZ samples recovered the excellent original performances, and gave hydride formation energies of 1.5-2.3 eV/D and 1.5-2.0 eV/H, which are anomalously high compared with values for bulk Pd metal. In the second phase after the deuteride formation, the Pd·Zr and Pd·Ni·Zr oxide composites charged exclusively with D2 sometimes gave significantly positive output, which should be subjected to repeated investigation.

"Anomalous heat effect by interaction of hydrogen isotope gas and metal nanocomposites supported by zirconia or by silica has been examined. Observed absorption and heat evolution at RT were not too large to be explained by some chemical processes. At elevated temperatures of 200–300 °C, most samples with binary metal nanocomposites produced excess power of 3–24 W lasting for up to several weeks. The excess power was observed not only in the D-Pd·Ni system but also in the HPd·Ni system and HCu·Ni system, while single-element nanoparticle samples produced no excess power. The Pd/Ni ratio is one of the keys to increase the excess power. The maximum phase-averaged excess heat energy exceeded 270 keV/D, and the integrated excess heat energy reached 100 MJ/mol-M or 90 MJ/mol-H. It is impossible to attribute the excess heat energy to any chemical reaction; it is possibly due to radiation-free nuclear process.",,,,,,

Our main experimental results from excess energy release (COP >1) in cold heterogeneous (nano-cluster) plasmoid are considered and analyzed in this work. These experimental results were obtained by our team during the last 20 years. The main results may be divided into four groups.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"(1) Excess energy release behind shock wave in a non-equilibrium heterogeneous plasma and plasma precursor creation before its front was revealed in our experiment. This measured energy is much higher than the electric energy consumed by the plasma, COP ~ 4–10. This excess energy is estimated by measured gas density and pressure behind shock wave, its propagation velocity in plasma, and by using gas dynamics conservation laws.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"(2) A systematic study of new chemical element creation in water by cold heterogeneous plasmoids was performed. The plasmoids are created by RF discharge over water surface. The plasmoid’s chemical composition is determined by optical spectroscopy. The chemical compositions of water and its sediment are studied by independent diagnostic methods: IR spectroscopy, atomic absorption spectroscopy, ion mass spectroscopy, chemical analysis and micro-X-ray spectroscopy. We observed optical lines of the H, Li, K, Ca, OH-molecular bands, CaO-molecular bands and unknown molecular bands inside red plasmoids. The Li concentration and the Ca concentration are increased in a water sample by factor 102",,,,,,

"Artificial stable microwave (MW) plasmoids were obtained and studied by Kapitsa in swirl gas flow. ThisMWplasmoid had unusual physical properties close to those of natural ball lightning. We studied the physical parameters and properties of a longitudinal heterogeneous plasmoid (plasma formation with erosive nano-clusters) created by capacity coupled high-frequency (HF) discharge in high-speed swirl flow in our previous papers. These nano-clusters were created by an electrode’s erosion in a plasma reactor. Measurement of the power balance of this heterogeneous plasmoid is very important for aluminium–hydrogen power energetics, using a new plasma generator with high coefficient of performance (COP). This work is a continuation of our previous work. We determined that there is extra power released in heterogeneous plasmoids created by combined discharge (HF discharge + DC discharge). The measured COP in this plasmoid is about 2–10. We suppose that this extra power release in a heterogeneous plasmoid is connected with LENR. The obtained experimental results (COP, optical spectra, soft X-ray spectra, chemical composition of dusty particles) prove our suggestion. It was revealed that a heterogeneous non-equilibrium plasmoid creates intensive soft X-ray radiation (with quantum energy about 1–10 keV). We determined that excited and charged cluster particles are responsible for this soft X-ray radiation creation, to be exact. Parameters of heterogeneous non-equilibrium plasmoid (Ne, Te, TV, TR and others) were measured in the experimental plasma vortex reactor (PVR). The main goals of this work are the following: (1) Creation of plasma-chemical vortex reactor (PVR) with high COP. (2) Obtaining of the key experimental results in this reactor for the future theoretical LENR model creation based on the PVR’s operation.",,,,,,

"Heterogeneous Hydrocarbon Plasma (HHP) was used in LENR experiments in the studies [1], [2] for the first time. This HHP was created by a pulsed erosive capillary plasma generator (PG). The working erosive substance PMMA (polymethyl-methacrylate, monomer-C5H8O2) was used in this PG. This work is a continuation of the previous ones [1], [2]. A calorimetric experiment with PG and distant Ni-foil cathode has been carried out in argon atmosphere (Pst~1 Bar). It was determined that HHP consists of the carbon nano-clusters and hydrogen atoms + hydrogen ions. These species are connected with dissociation of the initial PMMA. The interaction of HHP with thin Ni-foil target (width 0.1 ÷ 1 mm) has been studied in this work. HHP- jet heats, melts and evaporates this thin Ni-foil target. In a result of this interaction a small hole with diameter 1–3 mm in the Ni-foil target was burned by HHP-jet. Parameters of this hole were measured. Ni-foil weight was measured before and after the experiment also. It was revealed that the value COP was about of 5 ÷ 6 in this experiment (where COP = QT/Qe, QT – thermal energy of heating, melting and evaporating of the Ni-foil-target, Qe-electric energy input for HHP-jet creation). New transmuted chemical elements Li, Al, Ca,. . . were recorded in the HHP by the optical spectroscopy method, the EDS-method and the MS ICP method.",,,,,,

"It is well known that there are chemical element transmutations and its isotope composition transformations in LENR experiments [1], [2]. Time evolution of the transmuted chemical elements and their decay-instability have been studied in this work. New transmuted chemical elements (such as Fe, Cu, Ca. . . ) were obtained from the initial pure cathode material Ni (99.99%) by heterogeneous plasma formation in a plasma-vortex reactor [1], [2]. The chemical compositions of the initial cathode material and the transmuted chemical elements were measured by the EDS method and the ICP-MS method. It was revealed that there is considerable decay-instability of the obtained transmuted chemical elements at the time. This instability is accelerated dramatically by weakly ionized non-equilibrium plasma (WINP) action. It was confirmed that relative concentration of the initial Ni-atoms (cathode material erosion) is not changed, but the relative concentration of the transmuted atoms is dramatically decreased by WINP’s action. The author supposes that the theoretical model of bi-nuclear atom [4] can explain the obtained experimental results. Two-step transmutation method of the new chemical element creation in LENR experiment is proposed in this work at the first time.",,,,,,

The surface morphology that develops during strong acid etching is strongly influenced by the thickness of the type of oxide layer that forms during recrystallization and subsequent cooling.

"Some reports from ICCF22 (Takahashi et al., Iwamura et al., Parkhomov et al., Mizuno et al.) show that selected materials lead to higher power at higher temperatures, probably at temperatures below 2000 K, and pressures below 10 MPa. In the early part of this report, we show the theoretical extrapolation of data described in these recent reports which indicates that low energy nuclear reaction systems at temperatures over 7000 K may release energy at a rate comparable to combustion of fossil fuels, or perhaps even higher. It is also stressed that high pressure levels of 100 MPa physically will lead to less diffusion of H2 (or D2) gas from solid materials (e.g., powder of such as palladium or nickel) that have absorbed the gas. Less diffusion leads to higher power. In the present report, we propose a new reactor which may lead to power at the level of a chemical reaction such as combustion of fossil fuels. This reactor is based on two new basic technologies. Our first technology is a new device with a power source based on focusing compression due to pulsed supermulti-jets colliding around the reaction chamber center, which will have potential of the level of 7000 K and 100 MPa in chamber as maximum, leading to high power. It should be able to continuously produce power as an open system. The high compression potential at level of 100 MPa and 7000 K was confirmed by experiments and computational simulations without chemical and nuclear reactions. Our second technology is an injector of nanoparticles such as those of palladium or nickel, which remains durable for more than 30 hours, which may lead to continuous low energy nuclear reactions. These may make it possible to construct a heat source powered by a low energy nuclear reaction in nanoparticles such as palladium or nickel, which is triggered by a chemical reaction of H2 (or D2)-oxygen mixture, where the reactor is initially brought to a high temperature and high pressure.",,,,,,

"As reported in previous papers, anomalous heat generation occurs when nickel or palladium powder is exposed to hydrogen or deuterium gas, while there is also a chemical effect that occurs when hydrogen (or deuterium) gas is absorbed by mixed oxides of Pd and Zr. Many experiments were previously conducted while increasing either initial temperature or pressure in the reaction chamber. In this report, we conducted fundamental experiments of hydrogen gas absorption by metal powder, while increasing both temperature and pressure simultaneously. The experiments were conducted in conditions up to 244°C and 0.5 MPa, using a small constant-volume reaction system developed by us. As a result, about 4 K of temperature rise was observed in the experiment using nickel powder, and about 10 K was observed in the experiment using Pd-Ni-Zr composite powder. In these experimental results, there are positive correlations between the temperature rise and both the initial temperature and loaded gas pressure. This result may show that the temperature rise is assisted by not only preheating but also gas absorption under higher pressure.",,,,,,

"In previous paper [1-7] the author with Prof. Dr. C. Louis KERVRAN suggested the probable occurrence of the biological cold fusion or the biological transmutation of elements. In order to confirm the phenomena. under the more controlled condition, potassium, magnesium, iron and calcium were determined in cells of Aspergillus niger IFO 4066. Penicillium chrysogenum IFO 4689, Rhizopus nigricans IFO 5781, Mucor rouxii IFO 0396, Saccharomyces cerevisiae IFO 0308. Torulopsis utilis IFO 0396, Saccharomyces ellipsoideus IFO 0213 and Hansenula anomala IFO 0118 cultured in normal medium and media deficient in one of potassium, magnesium, iron or calcium. Values of potassium 1890 ~ 2650 μg. magnesium 380 ~ 510 μg. iron 95 - 120 μg, and calcium 60 ~ 95 μg were obtained per g dried cells cultured in each deficient medium, while potassium 8650 ~ 11050 μg, magnesium 1920 ~ 2160 μg, iron 510 - 680 μg, and calcium 380 ~ 450 μg were found per g dried cells obtained by cultivation in the normal medium.",,,,,,

"What is Cold Fusion? Cold fusion (CF) is a mixture of several claims that may or may not be related. Some of them belong to the realm of basic science while others belong to the area of patents. And some seem to be science fiction. From the point of view of history the CF episode, described in several books (1-7) and articles (8,9), is highly unusual. It is a situation in which the validity of research in one particular field has been officially questioned, at least in the US. According to many scientists, the cold fusion claims are in conflict with basic principles of physics and chemistry. That is why most researchers are no longer interested in cold fusion. Surprisingly, however, the field still attracts a large number of investigators with excellent credentials. Once a year they meet at international conferences and publish papers, most often in conference proceedings and over the Internet (10). As a nuclear physicist, and a physics teacher, I examined some of these publications and attended one cold fusion conference (11).",,,,,,

It was an attempt detect 3 MeV protons with the CR-39 chips. The idea was to develop an experiment suitable for student-oriented cold fusion projects. That is how the first author became a cold fusion researcher. After receiving the foil he sandwiched it between two CR-39 detectors for the period of 55 days. The area of each detector was one square inch. The exposure started three days after the sample was prepared (by keeping the titanium foil in deuterium gas at high temperature and pressure).",,,,,,

"The best way to start explaining CMNS is to refer to so-called ""hot fusion,"" a process in which two atomic nuclei of hydrogen fuse at temperatures exceeding several million degrees. This process generates thermal energy (heat) in hydrogen bombs, and in stars. In the last five decades numerous attempts have been made to turn a hydrogen bomb explosion into a ""slowly burning"" controllable process. This line of technological research, costing tens of billions of dollars, has not yet produced anything of practical use.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"Fusion of atomic nuclei has been studied by physicists since 1930s. We know that such fusion is only possible at extremely high temperatures. Its probability at ordinary temperatures-- that is below ten thousand degrees or so--is practically impossible, due to mutual electric repulsion of atomic nuclei.",,,,,,

"The stable existence of the thermal neutron assumed in the TNCF model has been discussed in this paper on the basis of the interaction of the neutron and the nuclei on the lattice points in the crystal. If an optimum shape of a boundary is formed stochastically, neutrons could be trapped in a crystal region surrounded by the boundary. The trapped neutron can form the neutron Cooper pair lowering its energy interacting each other through the phonon. The stabilized neutron, then, will not decay spontaneously and also not be captured by one of the lattice nuclei. To specify the stability of a neutron in a crystal, a new concept ""neutron affinity of a nucleus"" was introduced. Trapped neutron destabilized by a large perturbation can induce a trigger and succeeding breeding reactions resulting in the cold fusion phenomenon.",,,,,,

Synopsis,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"Nuclear transmutations (NT’s) and exotic surface topography observed in the surface layers of cathodes in electrolytic experiments by J. Dash et al. over the last ten years have been analyzed using the TNCF model. Surface topographies of the cathodes showed characteristic fine structures where the results of nuclear transmutation (NT) were detected. Nuclear transmutations, characterized by their locality, are accompanied by excess heat generation, which suggests a nuclear origin. The products of nuclear transmutation are explained either by decay of excited cathode element nuclei to form an element of higher mass number than the original (nuclear transmutation by decay, or NTD) or by fission of these nuclei (nuclear transmutation by fission, or NTF). The model was successfully used to analyze two cases of quantitative changes of isotope ratios in Ti and Pd cathodes and the surface topography change. . . .",,,,,,

"The working concept of ""cf-matter,"" defined as ""neutron drops in a thin neutron liquid"" as described in previous papers, is used to explain complex events, especially nuclear transmutations, in cold fusion phenomenon (CFP). In samples used in CF experiments, the cf‑matter contains high‑density neutron drops in surface/boundary regions while in the volume it contains only a few of them, in accordance with experimental data. Generation of various nuclear transmutations, the most interesting features in CFP, are explained naturally if we use the concept of the cf-matter. Qualitative correspondence between the relative isotopic abundance of elements in the universe and the number of observations of elements in CFP is shown using more than 40 experimental data, sets. This facts is an evidence showing statistically that CFP in transition-metal hydrides/deuterides is a low energy version of nuclear processes occurring in the stars catalyzed by, specific neutrons in the cf-matter formed in surface/boundary regions of CF materials.",,,,,,

"We summarize the nuclear transmutations observed in the cold fusion phenomenon (CFP) putting a weight on the biotransmutation, i.e. nuclear transmutations in biological systems. The CF materials, i.e. materials where occurs the CFP, are classified into three groups: (1) the metallic material includes transition-metal hydrides (e.g. NiHx, AuHx) and deuterides (e.g. PdDx, TiDx), (2) the carbonic material includes hydrogen graphite (HCx) and cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) and (3) the biological material includes microorganisms, microbial cultures and biological tissues or organs. We explain these characteristics briefly in this paper. The stabilization of unstable nuclei, including the decay-time shortening of radioactive nuclei, in the nuclear transmutation is especially interesting from the applicatory point of view in relation to the treatment of the hazardous nuclear waste accompanied to the nuclear power plant. A characteristic of biological systems where occurs selective adsorption of specific ions seems especially useful for the application. If we have a microorganism or microbial culture absorbing an ion of a radioactive element selectively, we can remediate the radioactivity by the biotransmutation.",,,,,,

After the first announcement reporting the observation of cold fusion further evidence supporting the same has appeared in scientific literature although many other groups have failed to obtain positive results. Palladium and titanium loaded electrolytically and titanium loaded directly with deuterium gas have been reported to emit neutrons. Interestingly gas loading experiments involving Pd-D have not been reported so far. Such experiments were therefore conducted recently in our group. Tritium measurements in gas loaded Pd-D targets have been carried out. The present paper summarises the results obtained so far to ascertain whether cold fusion reactions occur in gas loaded Pd targets also.,,,,,,

In a few cases titanium (Ti) has also been used as cathode. Ti is a material of interest as it can form deuteride up to the composition of TiD2 (against 0.6 in case of Pd). Further Ti is more easily available and cheaper in our country. Three groups have reported the use of Ti as the cathode material in their electrolytic experiments. Meanwhile in an interesting paper use of Ti in deuterium gas loading experiments has been reported wherein occurrence of neutron bursts under non-equilibrium conditions was observed.",,,,,,

"The first reports of observation of 'Cold Fusion' during the electrolysis of heavy water using Pd cathodes, resulted in frantic attempts in several laboratories of the world to duplicate these experiments and if possible improve upon them. Electrolytic cold fusion investigations were initiated at Trombay in the first week of April '89 as a collaborative effort between the Heavy Water and Neutron Physics Divisions of BARC. A commercial (Milton Roy) diffusion type Pd-Ag cathode/ Ni anode hydrogen generator which was readily available was employed for this purpose, after loading NaOD as electrolyte in place of the original NaOH. This paper gives details of the electrolyser characteristics, conditions of operation and the neutron and tritium measurements.",,,,,,

"This paper presents a new look at low-energy nuclear reaction research, a field that has developed from one of the most controversial subjects in science, cold fusion. Early in the history of this controversy, beginning in 1989, a strong polarity existed; many scientists fiercely defended the claim of new physical effects as well as a new process in which like-charged atomic nuclei overcome the Coulomb barrier at normal temperatures and pressures. Many other scientists considered the entire collection of physical observations -- along with the hypothesis of a cold fusion -- entirely a mistake. Twenty years later, some people who had dismissed the field in its entirety are considering the validity of at least some of the reported experimental phenomena. As well, some researchers in the field are wondering whether the underlying phenomena may be not a fusion process but a neutron capture/absorption process. In 2002, a related tabletop form of thermonuclear fusion was discovered in the field of acoustic inertial confinement fusion. We briefly review some of this work, as well.",,,,,,

"Demonstration experiments of excess heat generation have been conducted using the Fuel Cell Type Electrolysis System at NHE Laboratory since January 1994. In April 1995, a mass flow calorimetry system (FCS) was developed at the NHE Laboratory. A new series of experiments, referred to as NHE-FCS, combines the Fuel Cell Type Electrolysis System with mass flow calorimetry. The system is comprised of fuel cell type electrolysis cells, power supplies, vacuum insulators, water coolant, temperature measurement equipment, and a personal computer which controls the power supplies and digital multimeters. A data acquisition occurs every 60 seconds. Total input power is typically lOW. As a result of careful modification of the components, a heat recovery efficiency of -98% has been attained. It has been confirmed that an excess heat of 0.2W is measurable in calibration tests.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"Excess heat has been observed in the ""Fuel Cell Type Electrolysis System"". Observations of 7-18% excess heat have been reproduced in 11 cases. However, the reproducibility issue still remains. NHE-FCS experiments have been performed used identical protocol. Excess heat has not been observed yet in spite of the fact that we have attempted to duplicate the electrode materials that produced excess heat. One reason may be that other experimental conditions have differed in detail in cases in which excess heat has been observed.",,,,,,

This dipole- quadrupole interaction in combination with nuclear spin alignment and a presence of a vacancy in a light sublattice can produce very significant energy transfer from the phonon mode to the nucleus. Accumulated energy can exceed nuclear reaction barrier,,,,,,

"Significant elemental transmutations occur on cathodes comprised of either pure metals (Ni, Cu) or the alloys Kanthal (Fe0.74Cr0.21Al0.05) and Ni-Fe (Ni0.93Fe0.07) in light water electrolysis highly biased (~30 V) against a pure graphite anode. The utilization of graphite as an anode is advantageous because it avoids anode-driven contamination and establishes a distinct upper bound in the fusion products (Cu), which is different from upper bounds in previous studies (Pb or Ag) with a Pt anode. Whenever isotopic shifts were measured following transmutation, they differed from the natural ratios. Pure Ni cathode predominantly trans- mutes to Fe and Cu, pure Cu cathode transmutes to Fe and Mg, Kanthal shows the appearance of Cu and Mg and the Ni-Fe alloy transmutes to Mg and Cu. While the extent of transmutation in pure cathodes is a few tens of percent after about twelve hours of Cathodic Hydrogen Loading (CHL), Kanthal and Ni-Fe alloy show comparable or larger amounts of transmutations in less than an hour of CHL.",,,,,,

"In this contribution we show a case in which we have applied the Mossbauer spectroscopy for characterization of samples which were expected to show anomalous nuclear effects upon to their deuterization. The Mossbauer spectroscopy can provide information about the surrounding of a Mossbauer atom in deuterized samples by measuring the electrical monopole and quadrupole as well as magnetic dipole interactions. The introduction of deuterium (or hydrogen) into the vicinity of a resonance atom will influence the physical parameters which govern the Mossbauer spectrum, thus changes will be expected in the hyperfine interactions e.g. in isomer shift, quadrupole splitting, magnetic splitting (Fig. 1 ) and in other parameters. Consequently, the localization of deuterium can be sensitively studied. . . .",,,,,,

One can explain the cold fusion reaction by a permanent state of collision between the deuterons of the double layer. Each one collides with the total mass of the network with an energy surpassing the potential barrier. This state is determined by the dimension of the quantum mechanical path of deuterons under the Bohr-Heisenberg limit. The discussion of the quantum path of self could be bessered by a new model of quantum mechanical wave corpuscle.,,,,,,

"During sodium metal dissolution in aqueous Epsom salts, it was accidentally discovered that a massive explosion occurs in 0.85 M Epsom solution on the completion of Na dissolution. Borosil glass vaporizes at temperatures>1000°C. This fact indicated that a very high temperature has indeed been reached in this experiment. The timing of the explosion (20-25 s after Na addition) indicated that hydrogen somehow got trapped in cavitation induced meta-stable nano-crystals. The excess energy release could not be explained by conventional hydrogen combustion in air. One must therefore look elsewhere for an explanation of the process behind the excess energy release.",,,,,,

"Plausible mechanisms are discussed for explaining the sudden burst of energy released from 0.85MEpsom (MgSO4·7H2O) aqueous solution following sodium metal dissolution which led to the vaporization of the entire system including the glass beaker. Exothermic reactions lead to micro/nano-metastable crystal formation due to steam cavitation. H + 2 molecular ions trapped at Mg2+ ion lattice sites in cavitation-induced metastable crystals were considered as precursors for energy release. In principle, for charge compensation, two protons should occupy one Mg2+ lattice site in these crystals. Therefore, cavitation crystal formation brings in the two protons in molecular ions closer. This process is, however, opposed by Coulombic repulsion between the two protons which results in the collapse of the nanocrystal containing hydrogen. This leads to the release of hydrogen ions into the solution resulting in the release of hydration energy during the formation of H3O+, hydronium ions and in local heating. Stirring distributes the heat energy uniformly in the solution. Local heating, however, leads to the promotion of cavitation - this time with more vigor since additional energy input has occurred. Thus reformation of the crystal takes place quickly and the hydrogen ions are brought together more closer than during the previous occasion which increases the electrostatic repulsive force. As a result, the crystal collapses faster leading to the release of more hydration energy. This is how cavitation gains energy from repulsion. The above cavitation Coulombic repulsion oscillation (CCRO) cycle continues leading to an exponential build-up of the pressure and oscillation speed of the precursors and a decrease in inter-proton separation leading to their collision. Finally a sudden burst of energy witnessed occurs due to cavitation collapse. It remains to be ascertained if the energy release is a consequence of p-p fusion, or other mechanisms proposed which include volume casimir effect, miniature black holes and lattice phonon amplification. The fact that increase in the oscillation speed of the two protons in the proposed H + 2 species is exponential without an upper limit till the end-point is reached should determine the logistics of the underlying mechanism causing the energy release. The p-p fusion should, however, be accompanied by positron emission whose presence could be verified by its annihilation gamma rays or with 5.5 MeV gamma rays produced from HD fusion reactions if energetic deuterium is formed from p-p fusion in amounts commensurate with the energy produced but this fusion process is mediated by weak interaction process and hence is less probable. No other proposal explains burst of energy observed better than the collapse of miniature black holes.",,,,,,

"Abstract Previous experiments have shown that tritium is produced in deuterated titanium. To define better the phenomenon a series of tests have been performed using various metals and alloys and different deuterating conditions. Sheets and shavings of titanium, zirconium, hafnium, tantalum, Zircaloy 2 and Ti-Zr 50% alloy have been tested. A statistical analysis of the tritium production shows that significant differences are obtained varying the type of metal used. Using pure metals the tritium production increases with the increase of the atomic number of the metal. Moreover higher productions of tritium have been obtained using materials of technical purity as tantalum, Zircaloy 2 and Ti-Zr alloy.",,,,,,

"This report will discuss briefly some of the early calorimetric experiments on cold fusion and in more detail, a single experiment just concluded. A closed cell electrolytic experiment has been conducted using a palladium cathode and platinum anode with accurate (+/-0.001 watt) calorimetric measurements. Results indicate a positive energy output of approximately 50 Kilojoules more than was input to the experiment through electrolysis current and heater current. The heat output was observed both as short term bursts of energy and as long term sustained production. Colorimetric calibration with an internal heat source showed essentially identical data before and after the electrolysis experiment. Material balance for palladium, water and lithium showed essentially no material had been consumed during the experiment. Tritium levels measured before and after electrolysis showed a factor of 3 increase that cannot be accounted for by concentration effects.",,,,,,

"A constant heat flow calorimeter is described and its application to a Fleischmann-Pons experiment is detailed. In this calorimeter the electrolytic cell is contained in an isothermal chamber into which electrical power is fed from two separate sources. One source feeds biasing power Paux to an auxiliary resistive element located in the chamber while the other source provides, Pe, the electrochemical power requirements for the cell. The cell temperature T1 is maintained at its set point by varying Paux as needed. Clearly power needs to be removed from the cell if a steady state is to be maintained and this is accomplished by inducing heat flow through a thermal link to a reference body whose temperature T2 is less than T1. . . .",,,,,,

The U-type and bell jar type electrolytic cells were designed using pyrex glass and modified for recombination of gases with platinum catalysts. The electrolysis of LiOD/D2O in V-type cell yielded more final activities in Pt/Pd system than Pt/Pt system. Some electrolysis of LiOD/D2O in Pt/Pd showed the increase of 3T above 100%. The separation factor of D/T in electrolysis was not measured directly but assumed 2 ~ 3 from literature. The increase of 3T can not be explained with the isotope separation effect.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"But in the modified cells with recombination, the electrolysis yielded no significant increase of final tritium activities in the total system. In this case, recombined D2O was collected separately and total 3T activities were obtained by combining this with residue in D2O electrolytes.",,,,,,

Co-deposition was performed with a palladium salt/D2O solution. The content of tritium in D2O solution was varied depending on the electrolysis procedure during co-deposition. A comparison between the co-deposition of Pd/D and the simple electrolysis of D2O was performed to investigate the change of tritium concentration in the D2O solution.,,,,,,

"Progress made since 2007 in the triggering of excess power by terahertz stimulation of deuterated palladium is reported. The stimulation was provided by tuning dual lasers to one of three specific beat frequencies corresponding to the known optical phonon frequencies of deuterated palladium (8, 15, 20 THz).",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"Results imply that optical phonons may be involved in the Fleischmann-Pons effect, giving preliminary support to Hagelstein's phonon theory. The importance of laser beam polarization is also demonstrated, confirming earlier work reported by Violante et al., and by Letts and Cravens.",,,,,,

"This paper is a preliminary report on results obtained from a series of experiments conductedApril-September 2009. The experiments were designed to test for excess power using the basic methods disclosed in 1991 by Szpak, Mossier-Boss and Smith. A large and repeatable excess power signal was observed and the efforts to test mundane explanations for the signal are described. The design, fabrication and calibration methods of a new type of Seebeck calorimeter used for these experiments are also disclosed.",,,,,,

"In recent theoretical work, vacancies in PdD have been shown to be able to host molecular D2, which is conjectured to be necessary for excess heat in Fleischmann-Pons experiments. Vacancies in the original Fleischmann-Pons experiment are proposed to be created through inadvertent codeposition at high loading. This suggests that a better approach should be to focus on experiments in which Pd codeposition is controlled, such as in the Szpak experiment. Unfortunately, the Szpak experiment has proven difficult to replicate, and we conjecture that this is due to low D/Pd loading. A modified protocol has been tested in which codeposition is carried out at higher current density with a lower PdCl2 concentration. Positive results have been obtained in all of the tests done with this protocol so far.",,,,,,

"A high temperature Seebeck calorimeter capable of operating at 200–300°C was built and tested. The testing used a glow discharge tube containing plated palladium on the side walls and a molybdenum central anode. Running with deuterium gas and high voltages demonstrated excess thermal power at levels of 5–10 W but no excess power was observed when natural abundance hydrogen was used. In addition to the normal Seebeck measurements, excess power was also observed using back-off power measurements of the enclosure heater containing the Seebeck. A resistive control heater was used to verify the system.",,,,,,

The reactor tube is charged with a small amount of hydrogen loaded nickel powder plus some additives. The reaction is primarily initiated by heat from resistor coils inside the reactor tube. Measurement of the produced heat was performed with high-resolution thermal imaging cameras, recording data every second from the hot reactor tube. The measurements of electrical power input were performed with a large bandwidth three phase power analyzer. Data were collected in two experimental runs lasting 96 and 116 hours, respectively.

"New results are presented from an extended experimental investigation of anomalous heat production in a special type of reactor tube operating at high temperatures. The reactor, named E-Cat, is charged with a small amount of hydrogen-loaded nickel powder plus some additives, mainly Lithium. The reaction is primarily initiated by heat from resistor coils around the reactor tube. Measurements of the radiated power from the reactor were performed with high-resolution thermal imaging cameras. The measurements of electrical power input were performed with a large bandwidth three-phase power analyzer. Data were collected during 32 days of running in March 2014. The reactor operating point was set to about 1260ºC in the first half of the run, and at about 1400 °C in the second half. The measured energy balance between input and output heat yielded a COP factor of about 3.2 and 3.6 for the 1260ºC and 1400ºC runs, respectively. The total net energy obtained during the 32 days run was about 1.5 MWh. This amount of energy is far more than can be obtained from any known chemical sources in the small reactor volume. A sample of the fuel was carefully examined with respect to its isotopic composition before the run and after the run, using several standard methods: XPS, EDS, SIMS, ICP-MS and ICP-AES. The isotope composition in Lithium and Nickel was found to agree with the natural composition before the run, while after the run it was found to have changed substantially. Nuclear reactions are therefore indicated to be present in the run process, which however is hard to reconcile with the fact that no radioactivity was detected outside the reactor during the run.",,,,,,

"Paradigm shifts in physics have occurred at about 80-year intervals for the past 500 years. The periodicity of the paradigm shifts is due to the constraints of inhibition of apprehension and the difference between theoreticians and technicians, so that there is a three-generation periodicity. The various phenomena called ""cold fusion"" and associated physical anomalies are the grounds for another scientific revolution. If the historical pattern of paradigm development continues into the future, we can make predictions about this new physics and its economic effects. The Fluid Theory, Field Theory, and Q.M-Relativity Theory paradigms each led to an industrial revolution that happened about 55 or 80 years afterward.",,,,,,

"Microscopic ball lightning, smaller than a tenth of a millimeter, has been produced by electrical discharge and electrolysis experiments. It shares the anomalous characteristics of natural ball lightning such as the ability to bore holes in materials and transmute atoms. It groups and organizes in the same way as natural ball lightning, in chains and rings. It has anomalous effects on materials, putting atoms into an anomalous state in which the atoms flow, move, organize, and transmute. Atoms in this state may move with very little heat in their environment. Pictures of microscopic ball lightning effects from various authors are included in this article to help describe the behavior of the phenomenon.",,,,,,

"About 19 years ago, I developed a theory of scientific revolutions and economic depressions that allowed predictions that have been accurate. This general theory allows one to understand how the new plasmoid paradigm may develop over the next 100 years, if science continues to develop in the eighty year pattern it has had for the last 600 years. During the next 20 years, younger people may accept the new paradigm and develop the physical theories. About 40 years from now, if the paradigm is accepted by society, inventors and technicians will begin to invent the paradigm's major inventions. Along with explaining the economic and scientific predictions of this theory, this paper describes the history of plasmoid research relating to the cf/LENR field. Of particular interest to people nowadays, twenty years ago this model accurately predicted the timing and characteristics of the economic depressionary period that is starting now. This model ties the economic long-wave cycle to scientific revolutions in physics.",,,,,,

"Eight or 9 groups of researchers have reported that transmutation experiments are associated with the emission of anomalous objects that cause anomalous markings. Since the year 2000, Urutskoev et al., Savvatimova, Ivoilov, and Adamenko have published similar results, and several scientists are speculating that these emitted objects are Lochak monopoles. Plastic targets like CR-39 and nuclear emulsions of various kinds are used by researchers as a way to detect various particles and objects, and people are finding anomalous markings on their detectors and on their electrodes. Before them, Matsumoto, Shoulders and I reported finding similar markings in transmutation experiments. I found such markings on the components of an electrolysis cell [1]. I hypothesized that microscopic ball lightning is produced in transmutation experiments. Matsumoto accepted this idea when I told him, and Savvatimova and Urutskoev acknowledge that they have found tracks similar to those in the photographs published by Matsumoto [2, 3]. Their transmutation results are similar also. During this decade, several groups investigated these objects that evidence the characteristics and behavior of ball lightning.",,,,,,

Researchers of electrical discharge and electrolysis experiments have been finding microscopic markings that are unusual and anomalous. These markings are made by microscopic objects that are in the size range of 400 micrometers to 1 micrometer. These objects are a type of microscopic ball lightning. They share the anomalous characteristics of natural ball lightning (BL). Pictures of the markings and anomalous effects that were taken by six groups of researchers are shown and explained in this article.,,,,,,

Researchers of electrical discharge and electrolysis experiments have been finding microscopic markings that are unusual and anomalous. It is possible that these markings are made by microscopic objects that are in the size range of 400-0.1 Åm. These objects may be a type of microscopic ball lightning. They may share the anomalous characteristics of natural ball lightning. They are also finding highly anomalous material activity and emissions. Pictures of the markings and anomalous effects that were taken by six groups of researchers are shown and interpreted in this article.,,,,,,

"The traces and marks of micrometer-sized plasmoids have been found in many transmutation and cold fusion experiments. This author has counted about 12 groups that have published photographs that show such microscopic markings on their electrodes, experimental apparatus, X-ray films, or particle track-detecting nuclear emulsions. Twenty years ago, this author proposed a theory that these objects will be commonly produced in these kinds of devices. A survey article of such markings and traces exhibited in various experiments from the year 2000 to 2007 was published in this journal in 2009. In it, the author compared the markings to those previously detected by T. Matsumoto and K. Shoulders. In this letter, markings and features that were published more recently by Mosier-Boss et al. and Adamenko et al. are described. The author believes that this kind of highly anomalous microscopic plasmoid is similar to macroscopic natural ball lightning and so calls these objects ""microscopic ball lightning."" The author proposes that more focus on investigating these objects will greatly enhance the researchers' understanding of the processes involved in atomic transmutations.",,,,,,

Abstract Deuterium flux through the thin wall of a palladium tube has been studied by monitoring gas pressure and temperature. A high-precision calorimeter (Calvet) was used to detect heat flow when the heater was shut down and the palladium tube was cooling down slowly. At certain temperatures an abnormal deuterium flux appeared. This deuterium flux reached a peak when the temperature of the palladium was decreasing. This abnormal deuterium flux differs from the monotonic feature of a normal diffusive flux and is accompanied by a heat flow.,,,,,,

The WKB method is applied to calculate the reflection rate and the transmission rate for a single cell. Then matrix algebra is manipulated to give the relation between the single cell and an array of N cells. The selective resonant tunneling in this array of N cells is discussed, and the dependence of the absorption rate on the number of the cells is calculated to show the difference between coherent and non-coherent systems.",,,,,,

"Investigation on tritium was one of the recommendations in Energy Research Advisory Board (ERAB) report of U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) in November, 1989. Fifteen years evolution of the related research proved that it was an important recommendation. A selective resonant tunneling model is attempted to explain this discovery. Deuterium flux might be a key issue to solve the problem of the reproducibility. A further investigation is suggested based on this model.",,,,,,

"Selective Resonant tunneling model has been successful to explain the three major puzzles in cold fusion proposed by nuclear physicist (i.e. penetration of Coulomb barrier, no neutron emission, no gamma radiation), and successful also to explain the three major cross-section data in hot fusion(i.e. d+t, d+d, d+He3). Its prediction about 3-deuteron fusion has been found in experiments as well. The reasonable inference is the neutrino emission from the metal hydrides. The feasibility of detection of this neutrino is discussed in this note.",,,,,,

In addition, a peak-wise behavior is shown for the permeation of deuterium flux through the palladium thin film as a function of the number of nanometer coating layers in experiments and in theory.

"There were five blind men who tried to understand what an elephant was. The first touched the nose, and said that it was like a soft tube.

The fourth touched the body, and said it was like a wall. The fifth touched the tail, and said it was like a rope. This Chinese fable tells us that after more than 20 years of experimental study of anomalous phenomena in metal hydrides (deuterides), we are supposed to integrate our knowledge about these phenomena and extract an image of this ""big elephant."" Infinite Energy initiated this discussion about the ""elephant."" Logically speaking, one should read the 162 papers in Storms’ JCMNS paper, then comment on this new Storms paper.

One of the neutron detectors is close to the glass tube and another is far away from glass tube for background neutron level measurements. After 20 minutes discharge cleaning with 350V AC at this time increasing the voltage to 500v , the neutron counts are suddenly increased to the level higher than 4 times of the background.

"A (p+6Li) low energy resonance state is found using the 3-parameter formula for fusion cross-section based on the selective resonant tunneling model. The electron capture is the possible weak interaction to make use of this low energy resonance. When the resonance energy level is close to zero, the width of the resonance peak in the fusion cross-section is much greater than the width of the resonance energy level; therefore, the absorption through this low energy resonance level is no longer a problem for resonant tunneling of Coulomb barrier at low energy. Both hot fusion data and the CMNS experiment data support this resonant tunneling concept. As a result, lithium turns out to be an important additive in both CMNS and Hot Plasma fusion research.",,,,,,

"An investigation of elevated-temperature excess heat production in the Ti-D and Pd-D systems is presented here. A eutectic LiCl-KCl molten salt saturated with LiD is used as the electrolyte in a Pd/Al or Ti/Al electrochemical cell. Typical operating temperatures are around 370°C, which results in faster kinetics compared to room temperature operation. If this system can be developed for utility applications, high-grade heat and high thermodynamic efficiencies can be expected. Since the electrolyte provides a very reducing environment, metal surface oxides are readily removed; thus, this unique system offers the possibility of using less expensive materials than Pd. A modified isoperibol calorimeter was built for the excess power measurements. Preliminary results show high levels of excess power output, especially in the Pd-D system, although the effect remains sporadic.",,,,,,

Our previous work reported that the use of elevated-temperature deuteride-containing molten salts promises great potential for charging deuterium into metals for excess heat generation. Substantial excess heat was measured occasionally but was difficult to reproduce, which reduced the prospect of this technology. We believe an understanding of the reaction mechanism is critical for reproducibility.",,,,,,

"Am 23. März 1989 wurde die Welt in Aufregung versetzt, als zwei Chemiker berichteten, sie hätten eine Kernfusion bei Raumtemperatur beobachtet. Berichte einer neuen, vielversprechenden Energiequelle liefen um die Welt. Nach einem halben Jahr, einem Negativbericht des US-Energieministeriums und einigen gescheiterten Versuchen, das Experiment zu reproduzieren, setzte sich in Wissenschaft und Öffentlichkeit die Überzeugung durch, es habe sich um einen Fehlalarm gehandelt. Jenseits des wissenschaftlichen und öffentlichen Mainstreams jedoch haben Wissenschaftler in den letzten 15 Jahren die Forschung vorangetrieben. In Italien und Japan sind dafür öffentliche Gelder zur Verfügung gestellt worden. In Hunderten Experimenten wird mittlerweile von der Messung von Fusionsprodukten, der Umwandlung von Elementen und einem Energiegewinn berichtet. Die Erforscher der kalten Fusion haben erreicht, dass das US-Energieministerium diese Berichte nun überprüft. Gespannt wartet die Fachwelt auf den Review. Der vorliegende Bericht schildert Forschungsergebnisse aus 15 Jahren und fragt, wie es möglich war, dass außerhalb des Internets kaum Informationen darüber bekannt geworden sind. Als Hauptgrund wird genannt, dass die kalte Fusion bisherigen Erkenntnissen widerspricht, Fusion sei nur heiß möglich. Berichtet wird auch, wie die kalte Fusion von Teilen der Politik und der Wissenschaft aktiv bekämpft worden ist. In jedem Fall ist die kalte Fusion eine Konkurrenz für die heiße Fusion, in die als Energiequelle der Zukunft bereits Milliardenbeträge investiert worden sind.",,,,,,

It was found that during deuterium loading the probability of thermal neutron absorption in a strained Pd is increased by a factor 8 compared to the unstrained (annealed) sample or sample where loading is not carried out. Symmetric separation of Pd isotope pairs of Pd108-Pd105 and Pd110-Pd104 occurring in the subsurface layer down to 500 A depth in the cold worked Pd foil loaded with deuterium is observed. It is established that observed Pd isotope separation is solely defined by a strong plastic deformation (mechanical strain), induced by deuterium loading in Pd-matrix. The effect of Pd-isotopes separation is strongly enhanced under UTNF irradiation",,,,,,

"Abstract The new phenomenon of energetic alpha (up to 16.0 MeV) and proton (~1.7 MeV) emissions has been discovered from a metal surface possessing a large affinity for hydrogen and loaded/excited by electrolysis, glow discharge or powerful laser. These various experiments on charged particle detection show a remarkable feature, namely all exhibit a similar specific energy yield of long-range alphas (1 alpha particle per 10-15 eV input energy/Pd(Ti) target atom) independent of the excitation power of delivering method (electrolysis, glow discharge or laser irradiation). This result suggests the mechanism of energy transfer causing the energetic particle emissions in hydrogen loaded metal targets is similar despite the seemingly dissimilar excitation techniques.",,,,,,

The neutron energy is estimated to be in the range of En ~ 2.2 - 2.5 MeV with a rate of In ~ 1-3 n/s accounting for the 4 solid angle.

As a result, the mean energy of desorbed protons/deuterons (Ed) escaping from the hydride surface would effectively be increased from kT ~ 1/40 eV to several eV (Ed= F x a ~ 3-4 eV) or two orders of magnitude increase, effectively producing ""hot"" deuterons",,,,,,

Abstract,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"The objective of this work is to check the reliability of the initial Fleischmann and Pons calorimeter for studying cold fusion from ambient to boiling temperature. After describing our experimental set up, the assessment of excess heat from the enthalpy balance is discussed. We have observed deposits on the electrodes after electrolysis, which, in our opinion, have a determining role in the excess heat generation. We show raw data from three runs. It is concluded that this calorimeter is well adapted for such cold fusion investigation.",,,,,,

"We have measured excess heat in a Patterson type cell doing electrolysis of light water in Li2SO4 with a cathode made of 0.6 mm nickel palladium beads and a platinum anode. The cell employed is similar to the CETI cell, the main difference being its increased diameter, allowing the use of more beads and a larger current with a relatively low current density. The experiment lasted 90 days. We show that a total excess energy of 800 kJ is produced, and cannot be explained by a chemical reaction. No nuclear ashes have been searched for at this stage.",,,,,,

We show that up to 29% excess heat is produced at boiling, in accordance with our previous work, and in qualitative agreement with data obtained by Pons and Fleischmann but with lower magnitude. In addition we show that after boiling when the electrolyte is neutralized with sulfuric acid, excess heat is systematically observed at low temperature, even with platinum cathodes.",,,,,,

The purpose of this paper is to report on the continued work on utilizing a palladium electrode on a diamond sensor in a pressurized hydrogen or deuterium environment to investigate the release of radiation during low energy nuclear reactions (LENR). In this investigation we conducted a long hydrogen exposure to see if palladium electrode delamination occurred due to chemical reactions and it was found that after seven days the electrode did not delaminate. A pressurized deuterium run was conducted immediately following the hydrogen exposure on the same sensor and some interesting count burst data was observed. Further analysis is required to determine what the observed effect could be attributed to.,,,,,,

In-situ measurements on the resistance and temperature variations of Pd thin films are carried out during electrolysis. The measurement is made possible by covering parts of the Pd films with a protective layer of thermal and electric insulators. Electrical contacts are made by using either silver epoxy or indium soldering. The resistance-loading curve deviates somewhat from the typical curve for a bulk Pd/H(D) system. The initial resistance increase shows a much faster hydrogen diffusion rate along the film axis than that observed in bulk systems. The characteristic resistance-loading curve is explained by the electronic band structures of Pd loaded with different H(D) fractions. An excess heat of 30% during the electrolysis process was detected using an open calorimeter and a novel circuit switching methodology. The corresponding excess power density reaches 100 W/cm^3.,,,,,,

The results provide new insight into the charge state of H inside Pd. The H is slightly negatively charged over the composition range studied in this paper, and the negative charge around the proton increases with an increasing loading in hydrogen. By studying the behavior of H at the ""bridging"" site, which is also important to surface configuration, this paper helps explain why the effective charge observed in H drift experiments is different from the static charge state.",,,,,,

"The transport properties of palladium hydride/deuteride are investigated using state-of-the-art density functional computational tools. This aspect of loaded hydride is important in that the resistance-loading curve is often used as a diagnostic in experiments to estimate the loading ratio. Understanding transport provides other important insights into some features of the nuclear reaction mechanism. This research involves both ionic and electronic degrees of freedom. For the ionic part, the focus is on the charge state of hydrogen/deuteron, in both a static and a dynamic (hopping) situation. Experiments show that hydrogen hops as fractional-charged positive ion in Pd lattice [1,2] while previous band structure calculations [3-5] always gave a negatively charged H in the ground state. This discrepancy is addressed in the current research and some results are already published [6]. The collective motion of ions is studied in the phonon structure and electron-phonon coupling constant using a perturbation density functional theory. The electronic part focuses on the density of state and the Fermi surface, which when combined with the electron-phonon coupling constant, determine the temperature and the H/D loading dependant resistivity curves. Our numerical results [7] qualitatively match experimental trends. The possible connections between this transport theory/mechanism and the non-equilibrium conditions required for excess heat are discussed.",,,,,,

"Recent progress in understanding the screening effects of core level atomic electrons is summarized in this paper. Some preliminary results on core electron screening were reported before [1]. The studies focus on two types of nuclear reactions in some metal lattices: fusion between deuterons and also proton capture by medium and heavy lattice nuclei. In both reactions the energy of the light nuclear species, proton or deuteron, is on the KeV (1000 electron volts) scale, while that of heavy nuclei is essentially zero. A standard atomic code is used to obtain the core electron charge density and the potential profile in the metal atom. This Hartree-Fock-Slater type code was originally written by Herman and Skillman and later modified by others and available online. For the D-D reaction, the charge density obtained then gives an estimate on the screening length. The corresponding enhancement in Coulomb barrier tunneling can be obtained from this data. For the proton capture reaction, an ion dynamic code written to simulate the motion of KeV protons in Pd/Ni lattice, CLAIRE, was modified to take into account the realistic atomic potential, including core electron contributions. In both cases, our result shows a significant nuclear reaction enhancement. The reaction rate calculated roughly matches the scale of excess heat observed in some metal hydride/deuteride experiments.",,,,,,

The review is not meant to extensive, because it is aimed at understanding the abnormal and not-so-well-known part of the transport in the aforementioned compound that may be of particular importance to scientists studying Low-energy Nuclear Reactions (LENRs) as well as persons interested in hydrogen storage in metal hydrides. Many well-known properties of Pd/H, such as the steady-state electronic structure, have already been covered by numerous studies and reviews elsewhere. Many of the studies reviewed here were carried out at the University of Illinois. We focus on the three different but related topics: (1) The charge state of H in Pd, especially in the hopping process. (2) The electron-phonon interaction, and its role in the negative differential resistivity. (3) Defects and dislocations in Pd and their effects in the H state and its transport. The latter is of intellectual interest relative to our recent research on LENRs involving the conjectured formation of hydrogen/deuterium clusters in such defects.",,,,,,

"On January 14, 2011, Andrea Rossi submitted his ""Energy Catalyzer"" reactor, which burns hydrogen in a nickel catalyst, for examination by scientists at the University of Bologna and The INFN (National Institute of Nuclear Physics). The test was organized by Dr. Giuseppe Levi of INFN and the University of Bologna and was assisted by other members of the physics and chemistry faculties. This result was achieved without the production of any measurable nuclear radiation. The magnitude of this result suggests that there is a viable energy technology that uses commonly available materials, that does not produce carbon dioxide, and that does not produce radioactive waste and will be economical to build.",,,,,,

Dr. Les Case, an experienced chemical engineer with four degrees from MIT, announced what he is calling ""catalytic fusion"" -- to distinguish it somewhat from the original electrochemical approach. He had concluded that the electrochemical method of Fleischmann and Pons was going to continue to be limited by materials issues -- palladium cracking, composition, etc. -- and the inherent difficulties of working with electrochemical systems. Furthermore, he wanted to achieve the higher temperatures that are allowed by gas-phase systems.",,,,,,

"Reading this translation and compilation of a number of Prof. Louis Kervran’s pre-1970 works is very disturbing, producing the disorientation that accompanies a possible deep paradigm shift in science. Kervran (1901-1983), a medical scientist and engineer with a high official position in the French research and occupational health community, had a life-long interest in the possibility of biological transmutations. His curiosity apparently began in his youth when he watched the hens pecking at specks of mica in the farmyard. His later professional observations concerned (in one small part) the anomalous reappearance of robust calcium-bearing eggshells in calcium-deprived chickens that had been administered dietary mica (a potassium-rich mineral). Over a century earlier (in 1799), French chemist Louis Nicolas Vauquelin had noted this. The Kervran bio-transmutation story and its background is summarized eloquently in ""Alchemists in the Garden,"" a chapter of the best-selling book The Secret Life of Plants by Peter Tompkins and the late Christopher Bird.",,,,,,

"During the past 15 years, indisputable experimental evidence has built up for substantial excess heat (far beyond ordinary chemical energy) and low-energy nuclear reaction phenomena in specialized heavy hydrogen and ordinary hydrogen-containing systems.1 The primary theorists in the field that is properly designated Cold Fusion/LENR have generally assumed that the excess heat phenomena is commensurate with nuclear ash (such as helium), whether already identified or presumed to be present but not yet found. That was an excellent initial hypothesis. However, the commensurate nuclear ash hypothesis has not been proved, and appears to be approximately correct in only a few experiments. During this same period, compelling evidence— although not as broadly verified as data from cold fusion/LENR— has also emerged for other microphysical sources of energy that were previously unexpected by accepted physics. . . .",,,,,,

"Last December the world celebrated the 100th anniversary of the Wright brothers' triumph: the first controlled flight of a heavier-than-air craft on December 17, 1903. In honor of that now well-recognized historic event, we are reprinting a reflection by Wilbur Wright himself, which appeared in the Aero Club of America Bulletin in April 1912. The great aviation pioneer was celebrating the work of the now (2004) and then (1912) little-known Louis Pierre Mouillard, whose 1881 book, Empire of the Air, apparently played a seminal role in the history that led to the Wrights' accomplishment. It is a fascinating story that offers lessons for the struggling New Energy community. Sad to say, the very next month, on May 30, 1912, Wilbur Wright died of typhoid fever. His brother, Orville, who had piloted the first flight, lived on to 1948.",,,,,,

"Almost seven years ago in an issue of Infinite Energy (#15/16, July-November 1997), we discussed some of the material that follows. But in 2004, with the U.S. Department of Energy’s impending review of the past fifteen years of evidence for low-energy nuclear reactions (a.k.a. ""cold fusion""), it is an appropriate time to review -- in a fresh light -- a most critical turning point in the saga of cold fusion. In an episode which occurred in the spring of 1989, we find the seeds of the disastrous DOE response to cold fusion. Upon further investigation, I later found that the false premises that gave rise to the ""Cold Fusion War"" were evident as far back as 1964.",,,,,,

Thin Pd wires (diameter 50 micrometers) surface oxidized through joule heating have been loaded in a hydrogen (H2) atmosphere at pressures in the range 1 - 10 bar. The atomic ratio H/Pd reached in the experimental conditions has been evaluated through its relationship with the electrical resistivity of hydrogen-loaded Pd. It was found that the loading rate of the surface oxidized Pd wires is exceptionally higher than with the untreated ones (full loading in a few minutes as compared with several hours). It was also observed that surface treated wires with H/Pd = 0.75 do not lose hydrogen even when joule heated at temperatures up to about 150°C in a Hydrogen atmosphere. When the wire temperature exceeds 150°C (applied power about 12.4 W) anomalous heat generation (about 3.5 W) was detected.,,,,,,

Due to the relevance of the claims and considered the simplicity of the experimental apparatus, several tests have been performed in order to confirm the claimed results.

"In a continuation of the research started in the late 1990s at the University of Lecce, and then repeated in 2004, recently in the second half of 2014 in the A.R.G.A.L. lab., it was decided to thoroughly investigate the LENR anomalies of Pd–H2 system (in gaseous environment), having as reference the preparation techniques and surface analysis used in the microelectronics industry, to demonstrate convincingly that material contamination was not affecting the transmutation findings. As previously, the activation of the anomalies occurred during irradiation by low power lasers (633 nm, 1 mW, or 403 nm, 3 mW) on 250 nm thick palladium layers deposited by high vacuum e-beam evaporation on silicon oxide substrates, and with 30 nm of Cr as adhesion layer. In summary we did the following: in a stainless steel chamber filled with hydrogen, through a glass viewport, the sample surface was irradiated for two weeks and then accurately inspected in a SEM equipped with an EDX microprobe. A reference sample was also accurately analyzed before irradiation.",,,,,,

"Several types of experiments on LENR anomalies were performed at the ARGAL laboratory in Bareggio, in particular using thin films of palladium in H2 or D2 atmosphere at various pressures. The laboratory is equipped with instrumentation suitable for the detection of neutrons and gamma emission, with an He3 detector, and a multichannel detector with a 3-inch NaI crystal. All the experiments carried out have been monitored with these instruments, and in many cases we have found neutron emissions attributable to nuclear events inside the reactor. Some anomalous events were short-lived; others were prolonged for several minutes. Apart from one particular case, the events were modest. In any case, the evidence found shows once again the nuclear nature of the LENR phenomena, in the past highlighted by clear episodes of nuclear transmutations in similar conditions, where it was possible to analyze the material with the appropriate techniques at the end of the experiment.",,,,,,

"While it is known that nickel at a temperature of a few hundred degrees if in hydrogen can slowly absorb a certain amount of this gas, there is no evidence that this can occur at room temperature and at pressures below 1 bar. On the contrary, by conducting studies and experiments on LENR anomalies in the ARGAL laboratory in Bareggio, Italy, it has been experimentally verified several times that nickel in the form of wire, thin ribbon, foam, if properly covered with a thin layer of palladium, can absorb hydrogen in considerable quantities even at room temperature. Very often the neutron monitoring always active in the lab and close to the active reactor showed a significant rise in the background counts with two distinct peaks in the distribution of n / h (neutrons per hour) as will be better described in the following experiment description.",,,,,,

"Experiments of underwater spark discharges were performed with a thin lead wire. Discharges were made under two modes of DC and pulse Ae. Ordinary water mixed with potassium carbonate and hydroxide were used as electrolyte solutions. Products were observed with SEM, and those elements were analyzed with EDX and EPMA. Many remarkable products were obtained: interconnected electrons, transmuted products, thin C tubes, thin C films and hollow Pb balls. Here two processes of nuclear transmutation were separately observed: sequential e/p captures and nuclear collapse. The C tubes and films were produced by the nuclear collapse in the Pb balls. It would be amazing that the conventional light elements such as C, O and Fe were regenerated by the nuclear collapse.",,,,,,

In the closed type D2O /Pd electrolysis experiment, significant amount of helium-4 atom was detected in upper gas of electrolysis cell and inside the palladium cathode by QMS analysis. In the discharge type electrolysis experiment, anomalous elements were detected on the surface of cathode palladium by PIXE analysis after experiment. The detected elements are iron and zinc. Under electron beam irradiation to highly D-loaded palladium, anomalous spectra were taken in X-ray measurement.",,,,,,

"In experiments carried out in 1990 to investigate the application of the gas phase as a medium for cold fusion, a Pd vessel was exposed to deuterium gas, dissociated in an electric discharge at between -10 and -20 degrees C. The thickness of the metal was about one millimeter. In the first of a number of experiments positive indications of fusion were observed but these could not be repeated in subsequent experiments. The inability to repeat results has been found to occur in other cold fusion experiments and signifies that the processes involved are not understood (1). Since 1990, a number of results have been obtained which may put these earlier failures in a new light. In particular, the discovery by Miles (2), who reported positive results during electrolysis from 6mm thick rod after failure with Pd electrodes one mm thick. This introduces the bulk of the metal as a possible factor in the occurrence of cold fusion. Another noticeable feature of the absorption of deuterium in Pd is the obvious signs of cold work done on the metal. The surface is roughened, cracks appear and measurements show an apparent 15% increase in volume. With these factors in mind, a hypothesis has been formulated which seeks to explain how this might influence the process of cold fusion.",,,,,,

"An apparent irreproducibility in the production of an, as yet, anomalous excess power from Pd cathodes electrochemically loaded with D can be associated with irreproducibility in the attainment of several necessary starting conditions. Of these, the threshold loading (D/Pd atomic ratio) has received the most attention. A statistical analysis is presented of the results of 176 experiments intended to test the means of establishing reproducible control over D/Pd loading. A set of variables are examined, and procedures identified which permit the attainment of loading above the threshold necessary for excess heat production.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"Calorimetric results from two experiments are presented and analyzed. A mathematical function is identified which correlates closely with the time evolution of excess power. An important element of this correlation is the measured rate of change of the cathode resistivity. We have interpreted the resistance change as indicating the presence of an oscillation or ""breathing"" of the cathode loading induced by a flux of deuterons through the cathode/electrolyte interface.",,,,,,

In addition to these calorimetric experiments, extensive studies have been made of the electrochemical loading of deuterium into palladium obtained from a variety of sources.",,,,,,

The interpenetrating, continuous conductive elements formed by the solid phase metallic conductor (coating) and the porefilling electrolyte phase, extended in the dimension of current flow, form a system which can be modeled as an electrochemical transmission line. The results of such modeling can be used to predict the depth of electrochemical activity within a packed bed, and to estimate the proftle of hydrogen activity.",,,,,,

"Abstract The ability of palladium cathodes to attain and maintain high loading levels, at high current density and for long times, is controlled by two factors: the condition of the electrochemical interface which allows the attainment of high deuterium activity; the defect density and mechanical condition of the bulk material which permits the Pd lattice to withstand and contain high bulk deuterium activities when these equilibrate to produce extreme pressures of deuterium gas inside closed incipient voids within the metal. Examples are given from a set of 26 intentionally similar current ramps which show three distinct Modes of loading performance: Mode A - a linear decrease of Pd resistance, beyond the resistance maximum, with logarithmic increase in electrochemical current; Mode B - an initial log-linear decrease on the Mode A trajectory, followed by a rapid increase in resistance when the resistance falls below a critical value; Mode C - a shallow decrease in resistance with approximately symmetric increase as the [log] current density is increased beyond a threshold value similar to that for Mode B. Mode A is most frequently associated with the appearance of calorimetrically determined excess heat.",,,,,,

"Introduction  Numerous observations have been made of apparent anomalies in carefully performed experimental studies of D/Pd and H/Pd systems. Such anomalies include: prompt emission of electrons and charged particles; unexplained heat in excess of known input sources; the residual presence of light elements (notably 3H, 3He and 4He); the possible occurrence of isotope anomalies in higher mass elements (including the host metal); unusual electrical conductance effects both stable and transient (not discussed in this paper). The features that unify these apparently disparate observations are the common elements of the needed experimental stimuli, and the requirement for extended lattice coherent processes in any obvious explanation.",,,,,,

It has long been recognized that initiation of the cold fusion heat effect observed in heavy water electrolysis at palladium cathodes requires simultaneous attainment of three conditions: (i) high loading or chemical potential of D within the Pd lattice; (ii) an initiation time at least ten times larger than the D diffusion time constant: (iii) a minimum or threshold electrochemical surface current or current density that is not correlated to the bulk D loading. In 1995 a fourth condition was added with the recognition [5] that (iv) deuterium flux plays an important role in determining the excess heat power density.,,,,,,

"The resistance ratio method is the most frequent technique used to determine the extent of interstitial loading of hydrogen or deuterium atoms into palladium electrodes, or extended structures used in electrolytic or gas phase cold fusion experiments. Specifically, advantage is taken of an empirical relationship between the measured resistance, R, normalized to that of the same body at the same temperature in the absence of hydrogen isotope, R°, hence R/R°, and the atomic fraction occupancy of octahedral interstitials, x = H/Pd or D/Pd. This method was first suggested and employed in cold fusion studies by the present authors [1], and received immediate and widespread acceptance because of the ease with which this experimental technique could be used to make insitu, real-time measurements of a parameter, D/Pd, anticipated [2] or hypothesized [3-6] at that time to relate to cold fusion heat excess or nuclear production.",,,,,,

"Our object is to clarify in non-specialist terms what is known and what is understood in the general field of so called Low-Energy or Lattice Enhanced Nuclear Reactions (LENR). It is also crucial and timely to expose and elaborate what objections or reservations exist with regard to these new understandings. In essence, we are concerned with the answers to the following three questions: What do we think we know? Why do we think we know it? Why do doubts still exist in the broader scientific community? Progress in the LENR field will be reviewed with primary focus on the experimental work performed at SRI by and with its close collaborators with a view to defining experiments based non-traditional understandings of new physical effects in metal deuterides. Particular attention is directed to the Fleischmann-Pons Effect, nuclear level heat from the deuterium-palladium, and the associated nuclear products: 4He, 3He and 3H.",,,,,,

"ICCF16 marks nearly 22 years of research into the phenomenon first called ""cold fusion"". This newfield has expanded in breadth to the point that numerous acronyms compete to describe overlapping effects. Two of these are: LENR(LowEnergy Nuclear Reactions) and its subset FPE (the Fleischmann Pons Effect). Research to elucidate the basic processes and shed light on mechanisms has proceeded effectively continuously since March 1989 at SRI and elsewhere, and diligently and as ""time and funds"" have allowed at numerous other accomplished institutions worldwide. It is now clear to a well-informed but relatively small group of scientifically interested individuals that the deuterium-palladium systems conceals a heat source with energy exceeding by several orders of magnitude mechanical, lattice storage or chemical energy effects. Evidences of possible dd fusion products have been widely and numerously observed, at least partially ratifying the original speculative designation of ""cold fusion"". The effect, however, is apparently not limited to deuterium as a fuel, to helium as a product or to palladium as a matrix, hence the classification of the field as Condensed Matter Nuclear Science (CMNS) to differentiate these ""new"" effects from those observed in the rarified environments of particle and plasma physics. The materials-related issues associated with the so-called irreproducibility of CMNS effects presents the greatest barrier to the advancement and acceptance of the field. Precisely because we are dealing with condensed matter, micro-structural and micro-impurity control is difficult and expensive, requiring specialized equipment, control and skill. Problems of similar scale (and origin) have been faced and overcome in the past in the development of technologies having similar significance for mankind. Two (of many) examples are: the development of solid-state semiconductors; implementation of conventional nuclear power (and weapons). Absent another Bell Labs or Manhattan Project how should the CMNS field best proceed? Several overlapping options will be discussed. It is well within the capability of ""mainstream"" scientists and engineers in academia, and in national and private laboratories to resolve the materials issues and the questions of whether or not specific products are or are not present. Without funding they will not be encouraged to do so; without (a higher degree of) acceptance, adequate funding will not be made available. This paper will address various options and strategies to surmount this logical dilemma.",,,,,,

"Organization of this document. This history is being written in sections. The first ""episode"" covers the foundational years, ICCF1 through ICCF3. In perusing the rich photographic library that documents all of the eighteen ICCF conferences to date, I decided to choose content based upon those images. For the first three conferences the photographic record is slight but informational content is high. This historical document is intended to be faithful and inclusive. Part of our intent is to feature the cold fusion warriors that are no longer with us. It is important to document how we came to today, to ICCF19 — what forces were put in play to make the seemingly impossible transition from one conference to nineteen. In doing this the role of the International Advisory Committee (IAC) and the roles of the chairmen throughout the years are critical.",,,,,,

"SRI has shown over hundreds of electrochemical experiments that the Fleischmann–Pons heat effect can be generated if high current, high loading and deuterium flux are present. Until the work of Dardik and the Energetics group, we were unable to generate the deuterium flux synthetically. Using Dardik’s Superwave method to generate deuterium flux, we have shown that excess heat is regularly seen in PdDx electrolysis cells, given the appropriate cathode metallurgy.",,,,,,

"As a community, we have invested a great deal of time and money in investigating claims of anomalous heat first asserted by Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons in 1989. Despite this effort, we remain unable to specify the phenomenon or phenomena revealed. Although it is clear within the LENR community that the effect is of nuclear origin and is exo-energetic, we have yet to define with confidence the pathway to practical technology that seemed implicit in the original announcement. Bringing this community together largely is the belief that such a path is possible, or even imminent. What is taking us so long?",,,,,,

"It is clear to most who have studied the matter carefully that condensed matter nuclear science (CMNS) expresses a real and new phenomenon in physics. The efforts to communicate this reality outside a rather small group have not been very convincing. For something of such potential importance this dichotomy seems strange. How might we improve this situation? A working theory could certainly help, and better correlation between experimental variables, both input and output. A working demonstration that stood alone even as a toy could help facilitate communication directly with influential technical but non-specialist individuals and groups. Some thoughts on the possibilities and constraints are offered below.",,,,,,

"Spence and Vary have reported a resonance in calculations of positronium and hydrogen in the ""axion"" (0-) channel. The energy and lifetime of the positronium resonances have led these authors to suggest this new state as an explanation for the anomalous e+ e- peaks seen at GSI^3 . They and others speculate that similar states in hydrogen may explain anomalous nuclear reactions reported in metal lattices at low temperatures ( ""cold fusion"" ).",,,,,,
,,,,,,
Spence and Vary calculate the Bethe-Salpeter four-leg amplitude using a Blankenbechler-Sugar reduction. They use single photon exchange in Coulomb gauge for the kernel of their equations. Their results seem to depend critically on the use of this gauge. Attempts by others to reproduce their result in Feynman gauge have not been successful. The starting point in either calculation is gauge invariant so the reduction formalism must introduce spurious gauge dependence. Whether the results of Spence and Vary are spurious is not known at this time. . . .,,,,,,

"Abstract From its initial public announcement on 23 March 1989, the Fleischmann-Pons Effect (FPE) has been attributed to: nuclear fusion nuclear fission exotic chemistry some previously unidentified law of nature instrumental error.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"Highly public as well as private efforts were made in 1989 to decide if an FPE existed and if so, what caused it. This paper reevaluates some of the factual bases for the scientific and management judgments of 1989 with the advantage of what has been learned after four years of worldwide experimentation and analysis. We conclude that there is an FPE and its signature is heat. Data existed in 1989 that could have lead to this conclusion. The source of the excess heat is still not understood. Scientific progress was not made through this debate, which was largely uninformed by appropriate experimentation, and patent considerations may have played a determining role in the scientific progress associated with the FPE.",,,,,,

"Summary. The hydrogen evolution reaction at sintered nickel in H2O-K2CO3 electrolyte was investigated by electrochemical and calorimetric techniques. Hydrogen evolution was accomplished with surface conversion of Ni into ß-Ni-hydride, the extent of this reaction being strongly enhanced by temperature. Isoperibolic or isothermal calorimetry measurements show that electrochemical hydriding, especially at a temperature close to the boiling point of the electrolyte, is paralleled by anomalous heat evolution in large excess of electric power input. Electrochemically activated Ni electrodes, led in open circuit, keep on doing heat.",,,,,,

"The electrolytic insertion of deuterium into Pd at 95°C was investigated by a simple calorimetric technique. This involved continuous feeding of heating power to the electrolytic cell to maintain it isothermal with an external thermostatic bath: any extraneous thermal phenomenon taking place inside the cell is directly determined by the lack of balance of the original heating power input. It was thus found that Pd loading by deuterium is always paralleled by excess power generation, which largely exceeds the electrolytic power input. After prolonged electrolysis the loaded electrodes were found to continue heat generation in open circuit (o.c.) conditions. The reproducibility of the thermal phenomenon allowed its dependence on several experimental parameters to be investigated.",,,,,,

"Recent measurements of neutron emission from Ti metal in pressurized D2 gas have established the multiplicity distribution of neutron bursts emitted from the samples. A new 3He detector system with high sensitivity has been used to lower the detection limit so that small bursts emitting from 2-10 n can be distinguished from the cosmic-ray background. The frequency distribution of the neutrons indicates that the lower multiplicities occur much more frequently than the higher multiplicities as shown in Fig. 1. The improved sensitivity in our new detector system was obtained by using low radioactive background stainless-steel tubes, a small detector volume with high efficiency, and additional cosmic ray shielding. . . .",,,,,,

"During the past year, we have measured neutron emission from samples of titanium (Ti) metal and sponge in pressurized D2 gas. In January 1990, we improved our sample preparation procedure and our detector sensitivity level so that the neutron-emission measurements are now reproducible, but not yet predictable. We have measured excess neutron emission from the majority of our most recent samples using our high-sensitivity neutron detectors. The improved sensitivity in our new detector system was obtained by using low-radioactive-background stainless steel tubes, a small detector volume with high efficiency, and additional cosmic-ray shielding. Our most sensitive detector consists of two independent segments making up inner and outer rings of 3He tubes. The combined total efficiency is 44%. In addition to inner and outer ring segments, we have three separate detector systems operating in parallel control experiments to monitor environmental change. We have measured neutron bursts from a variety of samples containing Ti metal and D2 gas. The low-multiplicity bursts, emitting from 2 to 10 n, occur much more frequently than the higher multiplicity bursts. By measuring high-mass samples (300 g Ti) over several weeks, with many liquid nitrogen temperature cycles, we have detected neutron emission above the background from most of the samples with a significance level of 3 to 9 σ.",,,,,,

"A wide variety of neutron detector systems have been used at vari­ous research facilities to search for anomalous neutron emission from deuterated metals. Some of these detector systems are summarized here together with possible sources of spurious signals from electronic noise. During the past two years, we have performed experiments to measure neutron emission from pressurized D2 gas mixed with various forms of titanium metal chips and sponge. Details concerning the neutron detec­tors, experimental procedures, and results have been reported previ­ously. Our recent experiments have focused on increasing the low-level neutron emission and finding a way to trigger the emission. To improve our detection sensitivity, we have increased the shielding in our count­ing laboratory, changed to low-background 3He tubes, and set up addi­tional detector systems in deep underground counting stations.

"Excess heat has been reported in cold fusion experiments since 1989; however, there is at present no accepted explanation for what mechanisms are involved. Over the past decades a general theory has been developed which seems applicable to excess heat and other anomalies systematically; but in this case we do not yet have unambiguous experimental support for the phonon–nuclear coupling and enhanced up-conversion and down-conversion mechanism. This has motivated experimental studies with which we hope to develop relevant experimental results from which clear tests of theory can be made. A facility has been developed with which we are able to induce vibrations in metal plates from about 10 kHz up to about 10 MHz and then measure the relative displacement. With a high-power piezo transducer we have driven a steel plate at 2.23 MHz to produce a vibrational power of 100 W. We are able to detect X-rays with film, scintillator and camera, with low-cost sensitive scintillator/PMT detectors, and with an Amptek X-123 detector. We also have detectors that can see gamma and neutron emission.",,,,,,

"On May 20, 2017, we started a series of experiments with the goal of observing vibrationally induced excitation transfer of the 14.4 keV nuclear state from excited Fe-57 to ground state Fe-57 nuclei. A steel plate with a Co-57 substrate on the front surface was vibrated by a piezoelectric transducer near 2.21 MHz; and emission in the X-ray region was recorded with an Amptek X-123 detector on the front side, a scintillator/photomultiplier detector on the back side, and a Geiger counter on the back side. The experiments provided a negative result for the originally sought ultrasonically induced excitation transfer effect, but instead showed non-exponential time histories for photon counts on all three detectors. Specifically, increased emission of the 14.4 keV gamma, Fe K-alpha and K-beta X-rays was observed at early time. This enhancement was present at the start of the experiments at about 19% above expected levels for the 14.4 keV gamma, and about 17% for the Fe K-alpha, with the enhancement decaying away with a time constant of about 2.5 days. Emission on the Sn K-alpha was consistent with the expected exponential decay of Co-57 at the 1% level. Non-exponential decay with an enhancement at early time was also seen for the weak Fe K-alpha escape peak, and in the backside Geiger counter data; and a reduction at early times was seen on the higher energy channels of the scintillator/photomultiplier detector counter both looking at the back side. The observed non-exponential decay is connected with the tightening of bolts on wooden clamps on the corners of the steel plate, which apply mechanical stress to the sample. Candidate interpretations are considered, in which the stress induced in the steel results in scattering and generation of THz phonons by dislocations, and in which phonon–nuclear coupling mediated by THz phonons leads to the transfer of nuclear excitation to other nuclei (""excitation transfer""), which can cause spatial delocalization of the source and angular anisotropy of the photon emission.",,,,,,

"The repulsive Coulomb barrier between deuterium nuclei is reduced in length and height by a catalytic mechanism involving optical phonons and electric fields in a lattice. If this mechanism induces the formation of D- D+ pairs, the tightly bound and energetic electron pair (a ""lochon"" in the D- ion) becomes an attractive force between the nuclei. The lattice constraints and slow collision processes force the ions into a near 1-D configuration within the lattice that deepens the electron ground-state potential well. This permits the electron pair to remain closely bound to one deuteron and to do work in bringing the D- D+ pair together. The work done reduces the nuclear-mass deficit (transferring it to electron kinetic and field energy) and that, along with the reduced Coulomb repulsion of the nuclear protons, brings down the helium nuclear-energy levels of the fusing pair and raises the 4He fragmentation level. The proposed model accounts for the observations in condensed-matter nuclear science (CMNS) of excess heat (in both p-p and",,,,,,

"An electron pair (lochon) in a deep hydrogen ‘naught' orbit (n = 0) has similarities to muonic hydrogen in that it has a small orbital radius that allows the protons in molecular hydrogen to be very much closer together than is possible in a normal molecule. There are also significant differences between lochon- and muon-catalyzed fusion (e.g., one leads to ‘cold' fusion and the other the ‘hot' fusion). However, since muon-catalyzed fusion is an accepted phenomenon and Lattice-assisted Nuclear Reaction (LANR) or Low-energy Nuclear Reaction ( LENR) is not, we will examine the similarities and differences in various mechanisms with the fusion of deuterons in mind. We start with the assumption that both solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation are actually real and the one that has here-to-for been rejected correctly identifies a single deep orbit below the n = 1 ground state. (It is generally accepted that, at least for spinless bosons such as the lochon, this solution of the Klein-Gordon equation holds.) We then compare the creation model and characteristics of these two naught orbits with those of the muonic orbits (both atomic and molecular). The similarities lead both naught-orbit and muonic-orbit molecules to fusion. The differences lead the non-relativistic (but >100 MeV excess energy) muon-induced fusion of deuterons to the fragmentation of excited helium nuclei and the relativistic (but <10 eV excess energy) lochon-induced D-D fusion to an excited helium 4He* state that is below these fragmentation levels. The reason for this different response to the respective ""tight"" orbits is described along with some of the consequences, e.g., electron capture. In addition, internal conversion, a known physical process involving nucleon interaction with atomic electrons, is compared with the Extended Lochon Model to provide a means of de-exciting 4He* without production of energetic particles or radiation.",,,,,,

This paper deals with the palladium–deuteride (PdD) structure that is generally modeled with a deuterium-to-helium (D + D ) 4He) cold-fusion process. How this process results in transmutation is based on the extended-lochon model that predicts deep-orbit electrons that are tightly bound to the 4He nucleus and thus make the equivalent of a neutralized alpha particle. This model is compared with the NiH system (H + H)D, H##2 , or 2H#/ described earlier and distinguishes long-range from short-range transmutation (distance from the fusion site) as well as the relative excess energies from fusion vs. transmutation. The model predicts the probable transmutation process(es) and products in the palladium system and explains other observed results of cold-fusion experiments.",,,,,,

Recent work on the concept of a ‘linear hydrogen molecule within a lattice defect’ is emphasized by showing how the interatomic spacing of the unusual molecule is no longer bound by the lattice spacing. A concept of the nature of the Coulomb potential for finite-sized charges at nuclear distances is pictured so that people stop clinging to the point- and separated-charge descriptions that are no longer appropriate. A known force, spin-spin coupling, may be important when dimensions approach those of the nucleus. The strong magnetic moment of the electron, indicating the importance of this effect at larger distances, is also pictured.",,,,,,

Starting with the assumption that electrons can exist in these deep-Dirac levels (DDLs) with orbits in the femtometer range and 500 keV binding energies, the electromagnetic radiation fields and their coupling to both nuclear and atomic-electrons are identified. The shapes of both the nuclear potentials and the potential at the bottom of the Coulomb regime have a major role in the coupling between excited nucleons and the DDL electrons. The many orders-of-magnitude differences in frequency of the nucleons, the DDL electrons, and the atomic electrons account for the small interactions under normal circumstances. The changes in these frequencies in radioactive nuclides and for excitation of the DDL electrons account for many of the observed phenomena in cold fusion.",,,,,,

"Maly and Va’vra (M&V) in 1993 and 1995 presented a computational evaluation of the Dirac equations that included the ‘anomalous’ solution. The regular solutions of these equations are the basis for modern quantum mechanical predictions for comparison with the experimental values of atomic-electron orbital energies. The other solution, discussed in the literature for over 55 years, is relativistic and considered anomalous because its predicted levels are very deep (up to 511 keV) and have never been observed. Nevertheless, the existence of these deep levels provides a ready explanation of the mechanism for penetration of the Coulomb barrier and the means of D–D fusion below the 4He fragmentation levels. Since these levels also provide the basis for all of the other cold fusion observations (both PdD and NiH systems), it is important that arguments for and against the Dirac model be examined. The theoretical support for this anomalous solution is provided in a companion paper in this conference. This presentation seeks: to update the deep-orbit information provided in a poster at ICCF-17, to describe the nature of these deep–Dirac levels (DDLs), to report on additional, but unpublished, results presented by Va’vra in 1998, and to correct some interpretations of the model that Va’vra has provided in 2013. There are some unusual properties of the DDLs relative to those of the known atomic orbitals. Interpretation of the DDL properties, based on the non-relativistic solutions, leads to misunderstandings and further rejection of the concept of the deep levels. We hope to clarify this situation and indicate the importance of the calculations for cold fusion models. Cold fusion results provide a basis for understanding the DDLs and the proposed new fields of femto-physics and femto-chemistry.",,,,,,

"Starting with the assumption of validity of the Dirac equations (relativistic quantum mechanics), which are fundamental to much of atomic physics today, we also assume that the anomalous solutions to these equations are valid. If they are valid, then short-lived femto-atoms with electron orbitals in the low femto-meter range should exist. If femto-atoms exist, then the existence of femtomolecules could be expected. This paper addresses the possibility and nature of the femto-molecules and the nature of the forces creating them. The approach is that of Feynman’s molecular-hydrogen ion derivation using the Yukawa potential. The result is a molecular ion with femto-meter order spacing between the nuclei and an attractive potential identical with a medium-range Yukawa potential for an exchange particle with the mass of an electron. There are significant implications for both cold fusion and for nuclear physics and chemistry.",,,,,,

"Relativistic deep-orbit electrons (D-O-Es) have previously been identified as the probable mechanism in the development of lowenergy nuclear reaction (LENR) theories based on experimental Cold Fusion (CF) results. This present paper highlights how relativity and the near-field interactions (of deep-orbit electrons with both the nucleus and the lattice) predict accepted and many reported, but not-yet-accepted, CF observations. Included in the former category are: all of the new fragmentation ratios for the D+D => 4He CF nuclear reaction; a high-probability p–e–p => d reaction; a ‘fast’ decay process for transitions from excited to ground nuclear states; and a means of transferring excess nuclear energy to the lattice. Included in the latter category are: energy transfer from s-orbit atomic electrons to low-lying nuclear states; the formation of femto-atoms and femto-molecules – a basis for transmutations without the known ‘hard’ radiation (particulate or photonic) characteristic of neutron activation processes; selective attraction of femto-atoms/molecules to radio-nuclides (nuclear remediation); and the ‘preferred’ transmutation pathways in CF. Other effects, based on the published deep-orbit models, are predicted. Because of the successes of these models in explaining so much of CF, their mathematical basis is presently being explored beyond previous work(s). The physical bases for, and the consequences of, the mathematical predictions are proposed and described here. These include: special relativity and binding energy; the deBroglie term and spin-axis precessions; the deep-orbit quantum number, k; and deep-level splitting from spin–orbit, spin–spin, momentum and magnetic interactions. Theoretical concepts such as: symmetry breaking, ‘sequestration’, and elementary-particle mass changes to below their rest mass are also addressed. The new results and their interpretation, while incomplete, provide both satisfaction (in resolving prior issues) and surprises (in the magnitude and variety of near-nuclear effects).",,,,,,

"Limitations to contemporary models of Coulomb and nuclear interactions have previously been identified in the development of low-energy nuclear reaction (LENR) theories based on experimental Cold Fusion (CF) results. However, relativistic quantum mechanics has already provided a means to overcome these limitations. Nevertheless, this ‘anomalous’ solution has been repeatedly rejected, based on the mathematical formalism of an assumed singular potential, simply because it has not been necessary heretofore in the description of available physical data. The physical realities of a non-singular potential and its interaction with a relativistic electron are not new physics and provide a solid theoretical basis for CF (as indicated in another paper in this conference, and the references therein) and for new fields in femto-physics and nuclear chemistry. This present paper is essentially a reasoned complaint against those critics who proclaim the limitations of the anomalous solution, yet ignore the inapplicability of their chosen potential to the real world where they claim the solution(s) fail. It also castigates those physicists who accept the mathematical limitations as applicable to the real world even when presented with the evidence of assumptions made where they are no longer valid. The paper picks a few of these alleged limitations and shows how relativity and near-field interactions alter predictions based on the mathematical models and approximations used to characterize the conventionally accepted observations. It identifies where the simple models fail, or violate physical reality, and points to the implications of extending the models to better fit the real world and to properly understand the physical mechanism(s) involved.",,,,,,

"The relativistic quantum mechanics equations for atoms predict deep electron orbits with radii in the femto-meter range in addition to the known atomic orbitals. In prior papers, we have explored a model for the deep-orbit solutions of these relativistic equations and of the resulting hydrogen and helium femto-atoms (and even femto-molecules). One prediction of this model, based on observations from successful cold fusion (CF) results and previously mentioned, is that of hard-radiation-free transmutation. An extension of this important feature is that of the relativistic long-range electromagnetic forces of the deep-orbit electrons that can draw a femto-atom or molecule through a lattice to an excited or unstable nucleus. The earlier papers on this topic assumed the deep-orbit electrons to have kinetic energies in the 1–2 MeV range. Our recent work has replaced and/or augmented the low-MeV range with ~100 MeV values. These highly relativistic electrons create basically the same remediation characteristics as those at 1–2 MeV. . . .",,,,,,

"Three partial models for Low-Energy Nuclear Fusion (LENR) of hydrogen, H, or deuterium, D, are brought together in the context of 30 years of searching for the answer to the source of nuclear fusion without the requisite kinetic energy to overcome a nuclear Coulomb barrier. The earliest of these D+D cold fusion (CF) models is Julian Schwinger’s proposal (1990) to combine, in a single Hamiltonian, the attractive nuclear potential with the repulsive Coulomb potential to reach an excited state of 4He. The second was a pair of papers by Maly and Vavra (M&V) that, a few years later, provided a relativistic quantum mechanical model basis for deep electron orbits. A third was K.P. Sinha’s 1999 model to use a natural electron pairing in a lattice to form charge-polarized D+ D- pairs in a linear defect that is attractive rather than repulsive. Critical in Schwinger’s model is the ability to dissipate nuclear energy before the actual fusion of the nuclei takes place. Critical to M&V’s model is a deep-electron orbit predicted by relativistic quantum mechanics that, if occupied in deuterium, assured nuclear fusion. Critical in Sinha’s model is the ability to free the hydrogen sub-lattice spacing in a linear defect from the encompassing crystal’s lattice spacing. This present paper includes a connection with the more recently developed model (post-2015) of the deep-electron orbits and even more recent information (2019 and 2020) on new PdD phases and on models of properties of the hydrogen ""chain"". The importance and connection of each model’s contributions with recent information are highlighted. We are not proposing a specific model supported with detailed calculations. We are suggesting that (aspects of) prior models can be combined to form a unified (composite) model that would be more convincing to the other members of the Condensed Matter Nuclear Science (CMNS) community (and others) than they would be individually.",,,,,,

Excess power production and other anomalous effects have been observed during the electrolysis of heavy water using palladium and palladium-boron alloys as the cathode materials. This study focused on hydrogen and deuterium loading into palladium and palladium-boron alloys. Improved calorimetry provided for the detection of the exothermic heat of absorption of deuterium into palladium and palladium-alloy cathodes. The addition of boron to palladium does not significantly affect the initial loading rate but slows further loading to higher levels. The presence of boron in the palladium significantly slows the rate of the deloading process. Cracks or other surface defects prevent high loading levels of hydrogen or deuterium into palladium or palladium-boron alloys.,,,,,,

These improvements include the calorimetric hardware design, theoretical modeling, computerized experimental control, data acquisition, and extensive averaging of experimental measurements. The absolute calorimetric accuracy for operating over the entire temperature range from bath temperature to near boiling temperatures (0 to 5 watts of input power) was better than ±10 mW or ±1 %, whichever is larger. This improved calorimetry yielded a short-term precision of ±0.2 mW or ±0.1 % of the input power. The noise level (±0.1 % or ±0.2 mW, peak to peak) is very low compared to other known calorimetric systems in use.

"The simultaneous measurements of power and the rate of evolution of the electrolysis gases in our experiments prove that faradaic efficiencies less than 100% cannot account for our reports of excess heat. Furthermore, our calorimetric results are strikingly similar to reports from other laboratories including measurements in closed calorimetric systems where faradaic efficiencies are not a factor. Excess enthalpy for the Pd/D20 system generally involves high current densities that exceed 100 mA/cm2 ; therefore, the report by S. E. Jones et al. of low faradaic efficiencies using current densities of only 1 to 2 mA/cm2 is not applicable to cold fusion experiments. Based on experiments at our laboratory, there is compelling evidence that the anomalous excess heat is correlated with helium-4 production. For example, 30 out of 33 heat and helium studies yielded either excess helium when excess power was measured or no excess helium when no excess power was present. The probability of obtaining this result by random errors in our heat and helium measurements is very small. Permanent laboratory records always defined the presence or absence of excess power prior to any helium measurement. The measurement of helium in the electrolysis gas samples at three different laboratories places our rate of helium-4 production at 10^11 to 10^12 atoms/s per watt of excess power. This is the correct magnitude for typical deuteron fusion reactions that produce helium-4 as a product.",,,,,,

"Anomalously high radiation counts were observed using several different Geiger-Mueller (GM) detectors as well as sodium iodide (NaI) detectors during electrolysis experiments with palladium cathodes in heavy water. These high radiation counts were often observed in co-deposition experiments where palladium metal is deposited from a D2O solution onto a copper cathode in the presence of evolving deuterium gas. The anomalous radiation counts reached values as high as 73 sigma above normal background counts. The anomalous radiation would appear within a few hours in the co-deposition experiments where the palladium is loaded with deuterium as it deposits from solution. In contrast, the appearance of anomalous radiation required days of electrolysis for the palladium rods that load much slower. The real or artifact question stems mainly from the fact that two similar GM detectors often gave different results in monitoring the excess radiation. A few experiments, nevertheless, gave simultaneous anomalous effects from two different radiation detectors.",,,,,,

"My first three experiments conducted at NHE using the Fleischmann-Pons (F-P) Dewar type cells investigated the Pd-Ce-B, Pd-B, and Pd-Ce alloy cathodes. Significant excess power was produced from the cells using the Pd-B and Pd-Ce alloy cathodes. The Pd-Ce-B alloy, in contrast, showed no measureable excess power effects. Previous experiments at China Lake using similar Pd-B alloy cathodes prepared by the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) produced excess heat in seven out of eight experiments. The same Pd-Ce cathode that was used at NHE also produced significant excess power in previous experiments at China Lake. Due to the controversy over methods of data analysis for the F-P cells (see ICCF-5 Proceedings, 1995, pp. 105-115), I developed my own methods while at NHE. As I refined my methods for evaluating the calorimetric measurements, they approached more closely the methods outlined by Fleischmann and Pons in their Icarus Systems handbooks available at NHE. The method previously developed by NHE for the analysis of the F-P cells showed no excess heat for any of these same three experiments. The major problem with the NHE method is that a single calibration was used in determining the effective radiative heat transfer coefficient for the cell. An incorrect heat transfer coefficient can readily confuse the excess heat effect with the calorimetric error for the system. Calorimetric results for the same experiment using the NHE method, my method, and the F-P method for data analysis are compared. The fact that the alternative NHE method showed no excess heat for F-P cells illustrates the problem in transferring calorimetric methods from one laboratory to another. The second laboratory often fails to follow directions and makes changes that compromise the calorimetry. Similar problems were encountered in the attempt to transfer the China Lake calorimetry to NRL, hence excess heat was not observed.",,,,,,

Contrary to the conclusions reached in the N.H.E. report (1) we find that these experiments show ""Heat-after-Death"" and excess enthalpy generation at temperatures close to the boiling points of the electrolytes. The experiment using the Pd-B cathode also shows excess enthalpy generation in other temperature regions as well as the very early development of ""positive feedback"" (compare (10), (11), (12)). Such ""positive feedback"" complicates the analyses of the experiments.

"New experiments in sensitive calorimeters displayed the characteristics of the excess power effect during seven different occasions. These measurements clearly show the anomalous increase in the cell temperature despite the steadily decreasing electrical input power during Pd/D2O+LiOD/Pt electrolysis. This strange behavior can be modeled by the use of an anomalous excess power term in the calorimetric equations. Two thermistors used in each calorimetric cell always show nearly identical temperature changes, thus errors due to temperature gradients within the cell are unlikely. The onset of the excess power apparently develops in a gradual manner. There were never any large, abrupt increases in the excess power. The addition of D2O with its sudden cooling of the cell generally dissipated the excess power effect. No clear triggering events for the excess power could be identified. Possible chemical explanations for the excess power are discussed. Normal behavior was always observed for a similar experiment conducted as a control.",,,,,,

"ABSTRACT The excess enthalpy effect in cold fusion experiments for Pd/D2O + LiOD systems is subject to positive feedback, i.e., increasing the cell temperature increases the excess enthalpy. Therefore, the largest excess enthalpy effects are often observed near or at the boiling point corresponding to that of the electrolyte solution in the cell. The exact boiling temperatures at different electrolyte concentrations are needed for cold fusion experiments. These studies of LiOH in H2O and LiOD in D2O both show boiling point elevations at higher concentrations that are significantly lower than theoretical calculations based on ideal solutions. Activity coefficients of LiOD in D2O at the boiling point of D2O (101.42°C) are also reported. These boiling point measurements suggest a purity problem with heavy water samples that may contribute to the reproducibility problem for excess enthalpy.",,,,,,

"Three different sets of experiments conducted in the Navy Laboratory (NAWCWD) at China Lake, California (1990-1994) clearly established that helium-4 is the main fusion product in the Pd/D2O+LiOD electrolysis system. A correlation between excess enthalpy and excess helium-4 was measured in 18 out of 21 experiments. The observation of no excess enthalpy was correlated with no excess helium-4 in 12 out of 12 experiments. Thus 30 out of 33 experiments agree with the hypothesis that the excess enthalpy produced in cold fusion studies is correlated with helium-4 production: D + D --> 4He + 23.8 MeV. Furthermore, the measured rate of helium-4 production was always in the appropriate range of 10^10 to 10^12 atoms per second per watt of excess power.",,,,,,

"The main feature of the Fleischmann-Pons effect is excess heat production. My experiments designed to measure excess heat focused on the use of two types of isoperibolic calorimeters. Cells A and B transfer heat mainly by conduction while the three Fleischmann-Pons type cells transfer heat mainly by radiation. The first set of experiments in cells A and B used palladium cathodes. Small levels of excess power were observed in Cell A but none in Cell B. This result is in agreement with previous experiments at China Lake, California using the same two palladium cathodes. There were also periods of unusual fluctuations in the temperature readings in Cell A for the thermistor closest to the cathode that persisted for several weeks. These sudden temperature increases occurred during the same time period as when the excess heat was observed. The switching of these experiments to pulse electrolysis also produced an excess heat effect in Cell A but not in Cell B.",,,,,,

Exact calorimetric measurements, therefore, require modeling by a differential equation that accounts for all heat flow pathways into and out of the calorimetric systems.

"Important advantages exist for selecting a Dewar type isoperibolic calorimeter for measurements of anomalous excess enthalpy produced by the Fleischmann-Pons Effect (FPE). These advantages include a wide dynamic range for both the cell temperature and cell input power, direct visual observations inside the cell during calorimetric experiments, relative low cost, self-purification of the system, the safety of an open system, and heat transfer mainly by electromagnetic radiation. Various generations of this calorimetry are described along with the mathematical modeling. The use of control or ""blank"" experiments, such as replacing palladium by platinum, show that anomalous excess power is measurable to within ±0.1 mW using this electrochemical calorimetry. The application of this Dewar isoperibolic calorimetry at other laboratories such as NHE (Japan), Grenoble (France) and Harwell (U.K.) is discussed. Variations of isoperibolic calorimetry used by China Lake, Caltech, and M.I.T. are also examined where the main heat transfer pathway is by conduction. An improved version of the China Lake isoperibolic calorimeter is capable of measuring the small excess power (6.5 mW) produced at the beginning of an experiment by the exothermic absorption of deuterium into palladium.",,,,,,

"Experiments in the 0.025 M PdCl2 + 0.15 M ND4Cl + 0.15 M ND4OD/D2O co-deposition system produced anomalous excess power in three out of three prior experiments in Japan. Completely new experiments have produced even larger excess power effects for this deuterated co-deposition system. The largest excess power effect in D2O produced 1.7Wor about 13 W/g of palladium (160 W/cm3). These large excess power effects were absent in extensive studies of H2O controls. Excess power was also absent in various experiments involving the co-deposition of ruthenium (Ru), rhenium (Re), and nickel (Ni) in both H2O and D2O ammonia solutions. The statistical analysis of all 18 co-deposition experiments yields a probability of greater than 99.9989 % that the co-deposition excess power effect requires both palladium metal and D2O. Shuttle reactions have been proposed to explain the reproducible excess power effect in this ammonia co-deposition system. However, various electrochemical studies show no evidence for any shuttle reactions in this ammonia system. Nevertheless, the initial chemistry for the Pd system is complex leading to large pH changes, chlorine (Cl2) evolution, and the formation of nitrogen trichloride (NCl3) during the first few days. However, the large excess power effects are observed later in the experiments after this chemistry is completed. A better understanding of the chemistry should be helpful in the reproduction of anomalous excess power in co-deposition systems.",,,,,,

"Accurate isoperibolic calorimetry requires a well-defined heat transfer pathway from the calorimetric cell to a constant temperature water bath. The MIT isoperibolic calorimetric results published in 1990 had a major impact in convincing scientists, as well as US Patent officials, that the anomalous excess enthalpy reported in 1989 by Fleischmann and Pons in Pd/D systems was due to various calorimetric errors. Additional information about the MIT calorimetry has allowed a more detailed analysis. The major new finding is that the walls of the MIT calorimetric cell were so well insulated with glass wool (2.55 cm thickness) that the major heat transfer pathway was out of the cell top into the room air rather from the cell into the constant temperature water bath. This helps to explain the reported sensitivity of 40mWfor the MIT calorimetry versus the sensitivity of 0.1mWachieved for the Fleischmann-Pons Dewar calorimetry. The evaluation of calorimetric designs, accuracy of temperature measurements, electrolyte level effects, calorimetric equations, and data analysis methods leads to the clear conclusion that the Fleischmann-Pons calorimetry was far superior to that of MIT. Therefore, the results of the MIT calorimetry cannot be used as a refutation of the Fleischmann-Pons experiments.",,,,,,

Abstract,,,,,,
"The electrochemical co-deposition of ruthenium (Ru) proved challenging due to the numerous possible oxidation states of this metal. Ruthenium (III) nitrosylnitrate, Ru(NO)(NO3)3, was investigated in the NH4Cl + NH4OH/H2O and ND4Cl + ND4OD/D2O electrolytes. The ruthenium solution had an intense red color that remained unchanged during extensive electrolysis at constant currents of 6, 10, 20 and 100 mA. However, at a constant current of 400 mA, the solution became completely clear overnight with a black deposit of ruthenium metal covering the copper cathode. The collapsed cyclic voltammetric trace indicated a large electrode capacitance (1–2 F) and a large ruthenium surface area (105 cm2) similar to the previous observations for palladium co-deposition in this ammonia system. Extensive calorimetric studies using a constant current of 200 or 300 mA produced no measureable excess power in H2O or D2O for this ruthenium system. The very stable calorimetry allowed the determination of the effect of the electrolyte level on the cell constant at 0.0008 W/K mL for both the Ru/H2O and the Ru/D2O systems. The mean cell constants were 0.1318 ± 0.0025 W/K for the Ru/H2O study and 0.1312 ± 0.0025 W/K for the Ru/D2O experiment. There was no chemical excess power or shuttle reactions due to the nitrate ions present in these ruthenium solutions. In contrast to the palladium co-deposition studies, there was no detection of chlorine or nitrogen trichloride formation in any ruthenium co-deposition study. Based on out-gassing observations when the current was turned off, there was no absorption of hydrogen or deuterium within the bulk of the deposited ruthenium metal. Preliminary results are also reported for co-deposition studies of rhenium (Re), iridium (Ir), and nickel (Ni). Based on these new experiments with various metals, both palladium and D2O are essential for excess power in co-deposition studies.",,,,,,

"Two U.S. Navy laboratories reported important cold fusion results in 1991 at ICCF-2 in Como, Italy. Stan Szpak and Pam Boss reported studies involving co-deposition, and this author, along with Ben Bush, reported correlations at China Lake between the excess heat effect and helium-4 production. In January 1992, a Navy program began that was funded by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and involved NCCOSC-NRaD in San Diego (now SPAWAR), NAWC in China Lake, and NRL inWashington, D.C. The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) is recognized worldwide as a top research facility, and a major publication from NRL on positive cold fusion results would have been a game-changer for this field in 1992 and equivalent to the CalTech, Harwell and MIT negative cold fusion publications in 1989. Even today, a publication in a major scientific journal from NRL supporting cold fusion would likely have a dramatic effect on the acceptance of this new science.",,,,,,

"There were many letters exchanged between Martin Fleischmann and this author that reveal Fleischmann’s scientific thoughts about various cold fusion topics. These topics included possible critical factors for excess enthalpy effects in the palladium/deuterium system, errors in the CalTech, MIT and Harwell calorimetry, helium-4 production, critics such as Morrison, Taubes and Jones, and the advantages of using integrated forms of the calorimetric equations. Furthermore, Fleischmann mathematically shows that there is never a true steady state in the cell temperature for an open isoperibolic calorimetric system because both the cell heat transfer coefficient and the heat capacity of the cell change with time. Therefore, an important power term involving the change of the cell temperature with time has often been neglected by various groups using isoperibolic calorimetry. This power term is especially important when there are large changes in the cell temperature with time such as when the cell is first turned on.",,,,,,

"The Fleischmann–Pons Dewar isoperibolic calorimetry remains the most accurate system for measuring excess power in cold fusion experiments. The use of mathematical modelling and numerical integration of the experiment data, along with appropriate averaging methods, can achieve a calorimetric accuracy of 0.1 mW. The Fleischmann–Pons ""Lower Bound Method"" can be used to determine the heat-transfer co-efficient during an experiment and yields accurate results. Important information can be obtained from time periods where the cell is first turned on and when the cell is shut off. Periods of large cell temperature changes are accurately modelled by the differential equations. These Fleischmann–Pons calorimetric methods and equations are applied to a new experiment where excess power is produced in the Pd/D2O + 0.1 M KNO3 systems. A heat conduction calorimeter was used in this study, but the same methods and equations apply.",,,,,,

"One of the major goals of the U.S. Navy cold fusion program (1992-1995) was to produce our own palladium cathode materials at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). However, none of these Navy palladium metals and alloys were successful in producing the Fleischmann-Pons (F-P) excess power effect during the first two years. This all changed with the NRL preparation of palladium-boron (Pd-B) alloy cathodes in 1994. Seven out of eight experiments using these NRL Pd-B cathodes produced significant excess power in calorimetric studies at the Navy laboratory at China Lake, California (C/L). The one failure was related to a folded over metal region which acted as a long crack on the electrode surface. This success with Pd-B alloys made by NRL came too late to prevent the closure of the U.S. Navy cold fusion program in 1995, but these results are documented in a Navy report.",,,,,,

The derivatives of these equations gave correct values within the experimental error range for the important rate of change of the cell temperature with time (dT/dt). In addition, these calorimetric equations were also tested directly in determining the enthalpy change (Delta H) for the D2O electrolysis reaction. The mean experimental value at 298.15 K was Delta H = 294.4 ± 0.3 kJ/mole. This compares favorably (within 0.10%) with the literature value of Delta H = 294.600 kJ/mole.

"Palladium–Boron (Pd–B) cathodes prepared at the US Naval Research Laboratory have produced electrochemical excess power effects using D2O + LiOD electrolytes in nine often experiments conducted at three different laboratories and using three different types of calorimeters. The one failure was due to a structural defect in the Pd–B cathodes. An unusual result is the early appearance of the excess power effect for Pd-B cathodes. Three other research groups have also found excess power effects using these Navy Pd–B cathodes. Possible important factors for Pd–B electrodes are the removal of oxygen by the boron during processing, the increased mechanical strength versus pure palladium, less volumetric expansion of these electrodes during loading with deuterium, and the much slower escape of deuterium from this cathode.",,,,,,

The Eyring Absolute Rate Theory is generally applied to chemical reactions where bonds between atoms are broken and new bonds formed to give a transition state or activated complex. This theory has also been applied to physical rate processes such as diffusion and the viscosity of liquids. The activation parameters obtained from the Eyring theory when applied to cold fusion are all suggestive of a deuterium fusion rate controlled by the diffusion of deuterons within the palladium lattice. The D+D fusion process in the Pd/D system is apparently a zero-ordered reaction where only a small fraction of the reactants are in a location in which they are able to react.,,,,,,

"The thermoneutral potential (EH) for any electrochemical reaction corresponds to the enthalpy change (?H) for that reaction. The D2O electrolysis reaction produces an enthalpy change of ?H = 294.600 J/mol of D2O which yields a thermoneutral potential ofEH = -1.5267 V (-?H/2F ). This thermoneutral potential will apply throughout a Pd/D2O calorimetric experiment except for the first day or two where the loading of deuterium into the palladium cathode occurs. The changes in ?H and EH during loading and their effect on measurements of excess power will be presented. It is concluded that the changes in EH during deuterium loading do not explain the very early excess power measurements for Pd–B cathodes. Furthermore, boron may be a critical component for the excess power effect in the palladium – D2O system.",,,,,,

The immense potential energy benefits of CF (also referred to as Low Energy Nuclear Reactions, LENR) were immediately recognized. Humankind’s need for a source of cheap, clean, inexhaustible, and safe energy seemed to be realized. However, LENR was rejected by mainstream science within a few months, and it remains highly marginalized to this day. On the other hand, it has continued to be rigorously pursued by many investigators in several countries.",,,,,,

Dr. Mel Miles is one of the foremost researchers in the LENR field. He began his LENR research while at the Naval Air Weapons Center (NAWC) at China Lake.

The analysis of a run with 650-Å film of Ni is presented here. Following a two-week electrolytic run, the Ni film was found to contain Fe, Ag, Cu, Mg, and Cr, in concentrations exceeding 2 atom % each, plus a number of additional trace elements. These elements were at the most, only present in the initial film and the electrolyte plus other accessible cell components in much smaller amounts. That fact, combined with other data, such as deviations from natural isotope abundances, seemingly eliminates the alternate explanation of impurities concentrating in the film.",,,,,,

"Several research groups previously identified new elements in electrodes that appeared to be transmutation products (Bockris et al., 1996a; 1996b). However, due to the low concentrations involved, the distinction from possible impurities has been difficult. Now, by using a unique thin-film electrode configuration to isolate the transmutation region, plus measurements based on neutron activation analysis, the authors have achieved, for the first time, a quantitative measure of the yield of transmutation products. Results from a thinfilm (500-3000A) nickel coating on I-mm microspheres in a packed-bed type cell with I-molar LiS04-H2O electrolyte were reported recently at the Second International Conference on Low-Energy Nuclear Reactions (Miley and Patterson, 1996). Key new results are now presented for thin-film Pd and for multiple PdlNi layers. The transmutation products in all cases characteristically divide into four major groups with atomic number Z=.6-18; 22-35; 44-54; 75-85. Yields of -1 mg of key elements were obtained in a cell containing -1000 microspheres ~1/2 cc). In several cases over 40 atom % of the metal film consisted of these products after two weeks' operation.",,,,,,

Abstract,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"""Low Energy Nuclear Reactions"", or LENRs, typically involve electrolytes containing light water along with electrodes made of metals such as Ni, Ti and Pd. In these experiments a variety of reaction products (isotopes), with masses both higher and lower than that of the host electrode material, have been observed at the University of Illinois (U of IL). Related results, often termed ""transmutation"" studies, have been reported by other researchers. These observations suggest that proton-metal initiated reactions occur in such LENR cells. This paper discusses evidence that the production of these reaction products is correlated with the excess heat also frequently observed in LENR cells. Such a correlation for LENR reactions would be equivalent, in principle, to the correlation of He-4 with excess heat that is reported for heavy water-Pd experiments where a D-D reaction is postulated.",,,,,,

"The research described here includes work on fabrication techniques for reproducible thin-film electrodes. Runs with these electrodes in a newly fabricated high sensitivity calorimetry bank is shown to provide added support for earlier excess heat production observed with ultra-high proton loadings in thin film electrodes. In addition, new in-situ radiation emission studies have discovered MeV alpha-proton emission, supporting earlier reaction product evidence of the nuclear origin of the excess heat. Recent experiments and lattice simulation studies have provided added insight into highly loaded thin film phenomena, including possible H- effects associated with anomalous resistivity effects at ultra-high loadings. . . .",,,,,,

"Transmutation reactions in highly loaded hydrides have been reported by a number of research groups. These studies are briefly summarized with emphasis on common systematics and key ""signatures"". Transmutations divide into two types: heavy intermediate compound nucleus reactions yielding an array of products with a large spectrum of masses; direct reactions between H/D and the electrode metal or impurity atoms yielding isolated ""single"" products. Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the products and the ability to overcome the extremely large Columbic repulsion of the high-Z elements involved. Here we briefly consider a model involving orbital mixing and virtual neutron formation associated with charge accumulation and hydrogen/deuteron flow at highly loaded interfaces.",,,,,,

"Radiation emission from Low Energy Nuclear Radiation (LENR) electrodes (both charged-particle and x-rays) represents an important feature of LENR in general. Here, calibration, measurement techniques, and soft x-ray emission results from deuterium bombardment of a Pd target (cathode) placed in a pulsed deuterium glow discharge (PGD) are described. An x-ray intensity of 13.4 mW/cm^2 and a dose of 3.3 μJ/cm^2 were calculated over a 0.5 ms pulse time from AXUV photodiode radiation detector measurements. A most striking feature is that x-ray energies > 600 V are observed with a discharge voltage only about half of that value. To further investigate this phenomenon, emission during room temperature D-desorption from electrolytically loaded Pd:Dx cathodes was also studied. The x-ray emission energy observed was quite similar to the PGD case. However, the intensity in this case was almost 13 orders of magnitude lower due to the much lower deuterium fluxes involved.",,,,,,

Here we review some unique facts about a special class of LENRs leading to an array of transmutation products in thin-film electrodes of palladium (Pd) or nickel (Ni) highly loaded with hydrogen (H) or deuterium (D). This phenomena is explained in terms of the formation of an intermediate compound nucleus, one of which is identified as the double magic number compound nucleus . . .",,,,,,

The probability of pm-Ms reactions for low energy nuclear reactions LENR and the semiempirical derivation of 2 pm deuteron screening on palladium with a reduction factor 14 in Coulomb repulsion compared with a usual plasma factor 5 was confirmed later by direct experiments. Generation of 2pm distance clusters of about 150 deuterons based on this screening and possibly by a Casimir force permitted understanding of compound reactions as measured with the 155 nucleon minimum measured at LENR. These kinds of deuteron clusters were directly measured by SQUID. Based on screening and comparable values of a Wigner-Seitz radius for very dense deuteron clusters of stable Rydberg matter in defects of iron oxide with measured 2.3 pm nuclear distance is another access which may lead to an understanding of the LENR processes.,,,,,,

"Our recent research has developed a technique for imbedding ultra high density deuterium ""clusters"" (D cluster) in Palladium (Pd) thin film. Experiments have shown that in Pd these condensed matter state clusters approach metallic conditions, exhibiting super conducting properties. Using Temperature Programmed Desorption TPD system, the local concentration of hydrogen in the dislocation core is found to be [H]/[Pd]~1.8. At near 70 ºK Pd foil with abundant D clusters also show class II superconductivity, indicating the trapped hydrogen condensed into a metallic-like phase. Room temperature cluster formation is found to be adequate for the desired ""nuclear reactive"" sites. By careful calculation and experimentation, it is found the D cluster has a Bose Einstein Condensation state when a high deuteron diffusion flux is triggered. The resulting momentum transfer initiates reactions. The trigger can be electrochemical, giving LENR reactions. Thus this configuration can provide a small LENR power cell. Currently, we are searching for new methods to improve the volume density of dislocations. These methods mainly involve modifying Pd thin film with multi-layer structure.",,,,,,

"This paper reviews new and previous theoretical and experimental studies of the possibility of nuclear events in clusters created in multilayer thin film electrodes, including the correlation between excess heat, transmutations, and the cluster theory that predicts it. As a result of this added understanding of cluster reactions, a new class of electrodes is under study. These electrodes are designed to enhance cluster formation and subsequent reactions. Two approaches are under development. The first employs improved loading-unloading techniques, intended to obtain a higher volumetric density of sites favoring cluster formation. The second is designed to achieve Rydberg Matters. Various methods of exciting (triggering) cluster reactions are also discussed. Based on these insights, the design of Low-energy Nuclear Reaction (LENR) power cells is proposed. While still in the research stage, this approach promises ultimate development of ""green"" nuclear powered ""batteries"" offering remarkable energy densities well beyond present technology.",,,,,,

"Our previous experimental results have demonstrated the formation of ultra high-density hydrogen/deuterium nanoclusters with 10E24 atom/cm^3 in metal defects. Both experimental and theoretical studies have demonstrated that due to the close distance between ions in the cluster, they can easily be induced to undergo intense nuclear reactions among themselves and some neighboring lattice atoms. In view of their multi-body nature, such reactions are termed Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENRs) -- a terminology generally accepted by workers in the cold fusion field. Since the interacting ions have little momentum, the compound nucleus formed in these reactions is near the ground state so few energetic particles are emitted from it’s decay. Triggering excess heat generation, thus nuclear reactions in LENR experiments has been accomplished in various ways, all involving the loading of protons or deuterons into a solid metal or alloy material.",,,,,,

"Electrolytic hydrogen and deuterium loading into Pd and Pd-Rh alloys have been investigated applying various modes of surface modification: thiourea on Pd and Pd-Rh, Pd black on Pd and Pd-Rh and Pd-Rh deposit on Pd. From these systematic data role of the bulk and surface properties of the cathode in determining the maximum loading has been discussed. The cathode loading is improved for Pd and Pd-Rh with a surface modified by thiourea and Pd modified by Pd-Rh deposit, while reduction of the cathode loading was observed when the surface of the Pd-Rh alloy cathode was modified by P d -black. These results show clearly importance of controlling the surface catalytic property of the cathode in controlling and improving the maximum cathode loading. It has been found that DlP d > 0 . 95 can be achieved reproducibly in electrolyte solutions containing thiourea at high concentrations. However, electrolysis in solutions containing thiourea can be conducted successfully only when the anode and cathode are separated by an ion exchange membrane in order to avoid the",,,,,,

"Deuterium and protium gas absorption/adsorption by 0.1-µm! Pd powder (PP), Pd-black (PB), Pd nano-particles (""10nm!) admixed with ZrO2 (PZ) and Pd·Ni binary nano-particles (""2 nm!) dispersed in ZrO2 holder-flakes (PNZ2B) has been examined. For the PP, the PB and the PZ samples, both the deoxidized samples and those reused without baking process showed essentially the same values of the loading ratio D(H)/Pd, the specific output energy E1 and the hydridation energy QD(H) which are consistent with the published values for bulky samples. For the as-received and oxidized samples both D(H)/Pd and E1 are increasing functions of fineness of the Pd surface, and exceeds 2.0 and 1.5 eV/atom-Pd, respectively, for the PZ sample, giving the hydridation energy larger than the published value of the surface adsorption energy of 0.5 eV for bulky Pd samples. A rather large isotope effect in the differential heat of sorption, ""D(H), has sometimes been observed in the 1a-phase characteristic of the oxygen-treated samples. The Pd0.04Ni0.29Zr0.67 oxide composite sample, PNZ2B, has unique properties: Both D(H)/[Pd·Ni] # 3.0 and E1 # 1.4 eV/atom- [Pd·Ni] for the as-received, the oxidized and deoxidized sample runs are very large, while QD(H) = 0.50± 0.1 eV/atom-D(H) for all cases is modest. It is inferred that the Pd atoms act as a catalyst for the hydrogen isotope absorption/adsorption of Ni at room temperature. From the fact that the No. 2 run after the forced deoxidation has essentially the same values of the absorption parameters as those of the No. 1 and No. 3 runs, it is inferred that the surface adsorption potential is made shallower in the PNZ2B sample than in Pd-based samples. The ratio ""D/""H is sometimes greater than 1.5, which appears to be suggesting the existence of heat component of nuclear origin.",,,,,,

"The announcement of cold fusion in March 1989 at the University of Utah was greeted with worldwide hysteria. Drs. Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons had claimed that an electrochemical cell with heavy water electrolyte and a palladium cathode put out so much excess energy that the mysterious phenomenon had to be nuclear, and was probably a process related to nuclear fusion. Newspapers and magazines said it might be a major scientific discovery with the potential to end the energy crisis and revolutionize society. For a few heady weeks the public took it seriously and waited anxiously for laboratories to replicate the results. Many scientists quickly took sides for or against cold fusion - mostly against. Then, by the end of the summer of 1989 the official word came, in an authoritative report written by a select panel of experts under the auspices of the Department of Energy: cold fusion was a bust. It did not exist. It was an experimental error. It could not be reproduced. Nearly every scientific journal, magazine and newspaper on earth reported this, and cold fusion abruptly dropped out of the headlines. The story, it seemed, was over. Actually, it had barely begun. Only a few thousand electrochemists in the world were qualified to do the experiments, and most of them were too busy or not interested in trying. In that autumn as public interest faded and the U.S. Department of Energy pronounced a death sentence, a small number of experienced scientists prepared serious, full-scale experiments. One of them was Tadahiko Mizuno, an assistant professor who had been doing similar electrochemical experiments for more than twenty years.",,,,,,

Probability of the production of neutrons was discussed during electrolytic discharge at high voltage in a light and heavy water solution containing an alkaline ion. We employed a He-3 neutron detector and a NE-2 1 3 scintillator to measure neutron emission and energy distribution. We counted up to several million neutrons per second. High heat output of the order of several hundred watts was observed from input power of tens of watts,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"The neutron counts detected by the He-3 detector increased with discharge time after an induction period, and showed radical fluctuations. Absorption of neutrons by cadmium showed them to be thermal Copper and iron showed no count changes. The rate of neutron emission increased with the input volt Moreover, the rate was increased with the concentration of the ions and their mass number. Their rate was ten times higher in heavy water than light water solution. The neutron emission rate corresponded linearly with the input current, except at the low input coulomb range due to induction time. From this linear relation, it was observed that the typical dependence of neutron emission/current during 1 hour was 1000000 /s/A/cm2 for a platinum electrode in 0.5 molar potassium carbonate of heavy water solution.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
We can conclude that a nuclear reaction would be induced by the electric discharge on the metal surface in the solution. The reaction probably took place in the thin layer between the electrolyte and electrode.,,,,,,

1.1 Summary,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"Many elements on Pd electrodes were confirmed by several analytic methods; reaction products with the mass number up to 208 are deposited on palladium cathodes, which were subjected to electrolysis in a heavy water solution at high pressure, temperature, and current density for prolonged time. These masses were composed of many elements ranging from hydrogen to lead. Extraordinary changes of their isotopic distributions in the produced elements were observed; these were radically different from the ones found in nature. Essentially the same phenomenon was confirmed eight times with high reproducibility at high cathodic current density, above 0.2 A/cm^2. All the possibilities of contamination had been carefully eliminated by several pretreatments for the sample and electrolysis system. . . .",,,,,,

"Plasma was formed on the electrode surface in a liquid electrolyte when a metal cathode was polarized in high voltage electrolysis in the solution. During the plasma electrolysis large amounts of heat are sometimes generated. The heat can exceed input substantially, in some cases by up to 200 percent of input power. At the same time, anomalous elements are detected in the electrolyte and on the electrode surface.

"Plasma was formed on the surface of an electrode in a liquid solution when metal cathodes underwent high-voltage electrolysis. A real-time heat calibration system was designed for detecting the amount of heat generated during plasma electrolysis. The measured heat exceeded the input power substantially, and in some cases 200% of the input power. The heat generation process depended on the conditions for electrolysis. There was no excess heat at the beginning of plasma electrolysis. However, after plasma electrolysis for a long time, a large amount of heat was generated. The reproducibility would be 100% if all factors such as temperature, voltage and duration were optimized. Based on the heat and the products, we hypothesize that some unique reaction occurs on the cathode surface. This reaction may not occur at energy levels available during electrochemical electrolysis.",,,,,,

This is indirect proof that exceptionally high temperatures have been achieved. (Direct measurement of the reaction temperature has proved difficult.) Continuous generation of hydrogen above levels predicted by Faraday’s law is observed when temperature, current density, input voltage and electrode surface meet certain conditions.

,,,,,,
"We observed neutron emissions from pure deuterium gas after it was cooled in liquid nitrogen and placed in a magnetic field. Neutron emissions were observed in ten out of ten test cases. Neutron burst of 5.5 c/s were 1000 times higher than the background counts. These bursts occurred one or two times within a 300 second interval. The total neutron emission can be estimated from the counting efficiency, and it was 104 ~ 105 c/s. The reaction appears to be highly reproducible, reliably generating high neutron emissions. We conclude that the models proposed heretofore based upon d-d reactions are inadequate to explain the present results, which must involve magnetic field nuclear reactions.",,,,,,

"Direct decomposition of water is very difficult in normal conditions. Hydrogen gas can be usually obtained by electrolysis or by a pyrolysis reaction at high temperatures, starting at approximately 3700ºC. However, as we have already reported, anomalous heat generation can occur during plasma electrolysis, and this process makes it rather easy to achieve both electrolysis and pyrolysis simultaneously. In this paper we describe anomalous amounts of hydrogen and oxygen gas generated during plasma electrolysis. The generation of hydrogen far in excess of amounts predicted by Faraday’s law is continuously observed when conditions such as temperature, current density, input voltage and electrode surface are suitable. Non-Faraday generation of hydrogen gas sometimes produces more than 80 times as much hydrogen as normal electrolysis does. Unfortunately there have been few claimed replications of excess hydrogen, even in rare cases in which excess heat is claimed. In most cases, no excess heat or hydrogen is observed. The reaction products found after electrolysis were different after excess heat generation.",,,,,,

"Hydrogen has recently attracted attention as a possible solution to environmental and energy problems. If hydrogen should be considered an energy storage medium rather than a natural resource. However, free hydrogen does not exist on earth. Many techniques for obtaining hydrogen have been proposed. It can be reformulated from conventional hydrocarbon fuels, or obtained directly from water by electrolysis or high-temperature pyrolysis with a heat source such as a nuclear reactor. However, the efficiencies of these methods are low. The direct heating of water to sufficiently high temperatures for sustaining pyrolysis is very difficult. Pyrolysis occurs when the temperature exceeds 4000ºC. Thus plasma electrolysis may be a better alternative, it is not only easier to achieve than direct heating, but also appears to produce more hydrogen than ordinary electrolysis, as predicted by Faraday’s laws, which is indirect evidence that it produces very high temperatures. We also observed large amounts of free oxygen generated at the cathode, which is further evidence of direct decomposition, rather than electrolytic decomposition. To achieve the continuous generation of hydrogen with efficiencies exceeding Faraday efficiency, it is necessary to control the surface conditions of the electrode, plasma electrolysis temperature, current density and input voltage. The minimum input voltage required induce the plasma state depends on the density and temperature of the solution, it was estimated as 120V in this study. The lowest electrolyte temperature at which plasma forms is ~75ºC. We have observed as much as 80 times more hydrogen generated by plasma electrolysis than by conventional electrolysis at 300 V.",,,,,,

"When phenanthrene (a heavy oil fraction) is subjected to high pressure and heat in a reactor with a metal catalyzer, it produces a markedly anomalous reaction. It produces excess heat and weak radiation, specifically x-rays and gamma-rays. Furthermore, after the reaction finishes, mass spectroscopy reveals what appears to be 13C. It is very difficult to explain the total energy generation as a conventional chemical reaction. After the experiment, almost all phenanthrene and hydrogen gas remains in the same condition they were initially. There are few reaction products such as other chemical compounds. However, the formation enthalpies for these compounds are all negative. The heat generation sometimes reaches 0.1 kW and has continued for several hours.

"We have confirmed unusual reaction when heavy oil is heated in high pressure hydrogen gas with a metal catalyzer. Excess heat and weak radiation that assumed to be x-rays and gamma-rays were observed. After the test, almost of the sample and hydrogen gas remains in the same condition they were initially. There are reaction products such as other chemical compounds. However, the formation enthalpies for these compounds are estimated as endothermic. The heat generation sometimes reaches 0.1kW and has continued for several hours. There is a reasonably significant correspondence between the heat generation and the radiation emission. We have confirmed the same result with high reproducibility by controlling temperature and pressure. The anomalous energy generation cannot be the product of a conventional chemical reaction for the following reasons: At these temperatures, hydrogenation reactions are endothermic, not exothermic. The total heat release far exceeded any known chemical reaction with this mass of reactants. There is virtually no chemical fuel in the cell. There were few chemical reaction products. The components and chemical species in the cell including oil and hydrogen gas remained essentially as they were when experiment began, except that the platinum screen was coated with carbon. The emissions are thought that had been generated from some nuclear reaction. The reaction is reliably triggered by raising temperatures above the threshold temperature of ~530°C and the hydrogen pressures above 60 atm. It can be quenched by lowering the temperature inside the cell below ~500°C. When the necessary conditions are achieved, generation of heat is observed with high reproducibility. However, the amount of heat generated is not stable. Only a small amount of reactant is consumed during the experiment, presumably by conventional chemical reactions. We conclude the following: Anomalous heat generation was confirmed during heating of sample in high pressure H2 gas. Sporadic emission was confirmed during high temperature experiment. A weak correlation was observed between heat and the emissions.",,,,,,

"Abstract: Securing new sources of energy has become a major concern, because fossil fuels are expected to be depleted within several decades. In some of the major wars of the 20th century, control of oil was either a proximate cause or a decisive factor in the outcome. Especially in Japan and Germany, a great deal of research was devoted to making liquid fuels from coal. In one such experiment, a large amount of excess heat was observed. The present study was devoted to replicating and controlling that excess heat effect. The reactant is phenanthrene, a heavy oil fraction, which is subjected to high pressure and high heat in the presence of a metal catalyst. This results in the production of excess heat and strong penetrating electromagnetic radiation. After the reaction, an analysis of residual gas reveals a variety of hydrocarbons, but it seems unlikely that these products can explain the excess heat. Most of them form endothermically, and furthermore heat production reached 60 W. Overall heat production exceeded any conceivable chemical reaction by two orders of magnitude.",,,,,,

"Two methods of generating excess heat with palladium on nickel are described: an older method, and a newer, faster method. With the older method after sufficient pretreatment, the output heat peaked at 232 W, which was nearly two times input power. However, the pretreatment was complicated and took many weeks or in some cases months before heat appeared. The newer method is to directly apply palladium to nickel. This is simpler and quicker, taking only about a day, but so far it has produced only 10–30 W, and 40 W in one instance.",,,,,,

"Two methods of generating excess heat with palladium on nickel are described: an older method, and a newer, faster method. With the older method after sufficient pretreatment, the output heat peaked at 232 W, which was nearly two times input power. However, the pretreatment was complicated and took many weeks or in some cases months before heat appeared. The newer method is to directly apply palladium to nickel. This is simpler and quicker, taking only about a day, but so far it has produced only 10-30 W, and 40 Win one instance.",,,,,,

"After two years the puzzle of nuclear phenomena in a metal lattice (cold fusion) is still with us. Excess heat, or anomalous neutron emission was the goal being searched in most of the ""cold fusion"" experiments, however, we switched to search the precursor and the energetic charged particles in stead of excess heat or anomalous neutron emission. In fact, we started the electrolysis cell experiment early in April, 1989; the neutron bursts were detected by BF3 detector, and the tritium was measured by liquid scintillation detector. The sporadic nature of the signals and the difficulties in reproducing these signals forced us to look for a new approach in identifying this anomalous nuclear effect.",,,,,,

"Experimental results on Cold Fusion are reviewed. Most experiments find no effect and the upper limits are appreciably lower than the positive effects claimed in some experiments. It is concluded that (a) there is no excess heat production, (b) the balance of evidence is strongly against fusion products. A curious Regionalisation of Results is observed where only negative results are found in some parts of the world and only positive results in other pans. Further the ratio of positive to negative results varies with time. Previous studies of Palladium indicate that fusion should not occur inside the metal.

"Twelve years have passed since the announcement on 23 March 1989 by professors Fleischmann and Pons that the generation of excess enthalpy occurs in electrochemical cells when palladium electrodes, immersed in D2O + LiOH electrolyte, are negatively polarized. The announcement, which came to be known as ""Cold Fusion,"" caused frenzied excitement. In both the scientific and news communities, fax machines were used to pass along fragments of rumor and ""facts."" (Yes, this was before wide spread use of the internet. One can only imagine what would happen now.) Companies and individuals rushed to file patents on yet to be proven ideas in hopes of winning the grand prize. Unfortunately, the phenomenon described by Fleischmann and Pons was far from being understood and even factors necessary for repeatability of the experiments were unknown. Over the next few months, the scientific community became divided into the ""believers"" and the ""skeptics."" The ""believers"" reported the results of their work with enthusiasm that at times overstated the significance of their results. On the other hand, many ""skeptics"" rejected the anomalous behavior of the polarized Pd/D system as a matter of conviction, i.e., without analyzing the presented material and always asking ""where are the neutrons?"" Funding for research quickly dried up as anything related to ""Cold Fusion"" was portrayed as a hoax and not worthy of funding. The term ""Cold Fusion"" took on a new definition much as the Ford Edsel had done years earlier. Dr. Frank E.

"FOREWORD The calorimetry of any electrochemical cell involves two types of activities: data collection and data evaluation. The required data are the cell potential-time and cell temperature-time series. The evaluation is based on conservation laws subject to constraints dictated by cell design and the adapted experimental procedure. Volume 2 of this report deals with the modeling and simulation of the Dewar-type calorimeter. It was written by Professor Fleischmann to provide an authoritative discussion of the calorimetry of electrochemical cells. The emphasis is on the interpretation of data and the accuracy of the determination of the excess enthalpy generation via the appropriate selection of heat transfer coefficients. The discussion of the calorimetry of the Dewar-type cells is presented in the form of technical report for a number of reasons, among them: (i) its length would likely prohibit publication in topical journals, (ii) to clarify misunderstandings regarding the principles of calorimetry as applied to electrochemical cell in general and to the cell employed by Fleischmann and his collaborators, in particular.

Earlier we reported that the pits generated in CR-39 detectors during Pd/D co-deposition experiments are consistent with those observed for pits that are of a nuclear origin. Spacer experiments and track modeling have been done to characterize the properties of the particles that generated the tracks in the CR-39 detectors. The effect of water on the energetics of the particles and their resultant tracks is discussed.,,,,,,

"In the Pd/D co-deposition process, working and counter electrodes are immersed in a solution of palladium chloride and lithium chloride in deuterated water. Palladium is then electrochemically reduced onto the surface of the working electrode in the presence of evolving deuterium gas. Electrodes prepared by Pd/D co-deposition exhibit highly expanded surfaces consisting of small spherical nodules. Because of this high surface area and electroplating in the presence of deuterium gas, the incubation time to achieve high D/Pd loadings necessary to initiate LENR is orders of magnitude less than required for bulk electrodes. Besides heat, the following nuclear emanations have been detected using Pd/D co-deposition: X-ray emission, tritium production, transmutation, and particle emission. Experimental details and results obtained over a twenty year period of research are discussed.",,,,,,

"Experiments using CR-39 detectors have shown that energetic particles and neutrons are emitted during Pd/D co-deposition. Using 6 μm Mylar between the CR-39 and the cathode, it has been shown that the majority of the tracks formed have energies on the order of 1-3 MeV. This conclusion was supported by computer analysis of the pits using the ‘Track_Test’ program developed by Nikezic and Yu. In this communication, additional analysis of the detectors will be discussed. In particular, it will be shown that the size distribution of the neutron-generated tracks on the back side of the CR-39 detectors are consistent with the occurrence of DD and DT fusion reactions. This is supported by the presence of triple tracks in the CR-39 as well as the energies of the charged particles as determined in the Mylar experiments.",,,,,,

"Given the response to the Fleischmann-Pons news conference in 1989, it became clear to many researchers in the field that excess heat was not convincing enough evidence to prove that nuclear processes were occurring inside a metal lattice. Skeptics attributed the excess heat to recombination of deuterium and oxygen gases and/or poor calorimetry, despite the fact that control experiments showed that this was not the case. Consequently, a number of researchers redirected their efforts from measuring heat to looking for nuclear products such as neutrons, charged particles, X- and gamma rays, and transmutation. The results of these efforts are discussed in this communication.",,,,,,

Our attempt to publish novel experimental results in a renowned physics journal shows that in some cases editors and reviewers are not impartial; they are biased and closed-minded. Although our subject matter was technical, its rejection was not: it was emotionally charged. It was an agenda-laden rejection of legitimate experiments that were conducted in US DoD and DoE laboratories. This paper describes the ?awed journal review process, detailing our own case and citing others.

The main advantages of these detectors over real-time electronic detectors are its integration capability and its ability to speciate energetic particles. Unlike real-time detectors, CR-39 can be placed in close proximity to the cathode and can be used for both electrolysis experiments and gas loading. These advantages of CR-39 detectors over real time, electronic detectors are particularly important when energetic particle emissions occur either sporadically in bursts or at a low flux.",,,,,,

At ICCF-2, Stan Szpak reported that thermometry showed that the heat source in Pd/D co-deposition was the cathode (this was later verified using infrared imagery), the emission of X-rays using photographic film, and tritium production. In the thermometry measurements done at NRaD, a large diameter cell was used and the anode and cathode were completely immersed in the electrolyte.",,,,,,

"On March 23, 1989, Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons, professors of chemistry at the University of Utah, held a press conference to announce the results of electrochemical experiments that produced more heat than could be accounted for by chemical means. They speculated that the heat had a nuclear origin. The experiments were quickly dubbed ""Cold Fusion"" by the news media. The physics community noted that Fleischmann and Pons had not published their results in any journal prior to their announcement, there had been no reports of any replications of the effect, there was no mention of the generation of any nuclear ash, and that the reported results did not match theory. Despite these perceived irregularities scientists, worldwide, went into their laboratories to replicate the Fleischmann–Pons results. A few scientists succeeded but a great many more failed. It is now known that those failures were due to the fact that the experimental conditions necessary to achieve the effect, i.e., high D loading and high D flux inside the Pd lattice, had not been achieved. Ultimately, the lack of replication by others and the fact that Fleischmann and Pons were not able to defend their original claims caused most scientists to lose interest.",,,,,,

"The selective nuclear transmutation from 88Sr to 96Mo reported by Iwamura et al. was investigated replacing electrochemical deposition with ion implantation for seeding 88Sr+ and replacing a quadrupole mass spectrometer with a time of flight mass spectrometer for secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) for analysis of possible transmuted products. At the surface of the Sr implanted Pd/CaO multilayer foil, Mo was clearly detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) after deuterium gas permeation. After the D2 permeation, the sample was heat treated in the air to remove S which condensed at the surface during the permeation. After the successful removal of S, Mo could be clearly detected by XPS on the surface of the 88Sr+ implanted Pd/CaO multilayer foil. The isotopic abundance ratio of the surface Mo measured by TOF-SIMS was similar to that of natural Mo. However, after the removal of the outermost surface layer with ion sputtering, the observed isotopic abundance ratio of Mo changed from that of natural Mo with an isolatedly strong peak at a mass close to 96Mo. This result duly suggests that the transmutation from 88Sr to 96Mo had took place, although the peak of m/z = 96 might be also assigned to GaAl+, Ca2O+ or CaFe+, beside 96Mo+. By further analyses of the TOF-SIMS data from the viewpoint of accurate masses, depth profiles and isotopic abundances, it was clarified that the peak of m/z = 96 was assigned to Ca2O+ originated from Pd/CaO multilayer.",,,,,,

INTRODUCTION,,,,,,

"The advancement of science and technology normally occurs through evolutionary research and development. These activities and their fruits, knowledge and capabilities, might be very interesting and useful, but they normally do not challenge our overall view of the world. When something revolutionary comes to light, the potential paradigm shift, then we are forced to examine both our knowledge and our beliefs, which are intertwined. The topic called ""cold fusion"" caused reexamination of the physics of nuclear reactions and some aspects of the philosophy of science. We will consider these factors after a brief introductory survey of the complex experiments and results reported in the field, and the motivations for continued attention. ""Cold fusion"" is used here as an accepted label for the arena of interest, and not a statement about whatever processes might be involved.",,,,,,

"Pd employed as cathodes in cold fusion experiments contains various defects, each of which has an associated energy. In principle, some of the energy in Pd due to defects that exist before a cold fusion experiment could be released as apparent excess heat during the experiment. Energy densities were computed for high concentrations of vacancies, impurities (both substitutional and interstitial atoms), dislocations and grain boundaries, as well as for strains. It is concluded that pre-existing defects and strains cannot account for the energies released during cold fusion experiments. Nonetheless, defects may play other supporting or central roles in cold fusion.",,,,,,

"Nuclear reactions that occur at low kinetic energies produce thermal energy at some rate (powers), nuclear reaction products (materials) and, in some cases, energetic photons or particles (radiations). Experimental evidence indicates that low energy nuclear reactions (LENR) occur on or very near to the surfaces of solid lattices. The rates of such reactions depend on the total area of the lattices in an LENR experiment, the fraction of that area which is active and the number of reactions per area per second. The powers further depend on the energy per reaction. The production rates of materials are related to the masses of the reaction products. And, the fluxes of radiations depend on the fraction of the reactions that produce energetic quanta. These factors are examined in this paper. A simple, but useful graphical method to relate surface areas to output nuclear powers is presented. It is used to make the first estimate of the active fraction of a surface in LENR experiments. Optimization of power outputs from LENR experiments is discussed in relation to the various factors cited above and to past work. The several intersections between LENR and both nano-science and nanotechnology are examined. A new engineering discipline will be required to turn the current science of LENR into practical sources of energy, materials and maybe radiations.",,,,,,

"The research topic which was first and poorly called ""cold fusion"" has been of international interest since its beginning in 1989. Hence, a series of International Conferences on Cold Fusion (ICCF) has been held on three continents during the past two decades. In recent years, the topic has come to be viewed as part of the larger field of Condensed Matter Nuclear Science; therefore conferences during the last few years have been called the International Conference on Condensed Matter Nuclear Science even though the moniker of ICCF has been maintained. At present, the key reactions are often called Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR), with the main scientific website on the topic being www.lenr.org. But there remains confusion not only about what to call the field, but about the several scientific riddles at the heart of the field.",,,,,,

"Asking questions is basic to many human functions. Without questions, the learning process in schools and universities would be vastly more difficult and less effective. FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) are a standard part of many websites now. The posing of questions is also an activity fundamental to diverse planning activities, ranging from the formulation of programs to the design of cities. And, questions, commonly driven by ""mere"" curiosity, are the driving force behind science. So, one can ask: what questions are applicable to the field of low energy, or alternatively, lattice-enabled nuclear reactions (LENR)? That is one of the motivations behind this compilation of some questions, which are asked because they seem significant. The answers are largely the opinions of this author.",,,,,,

"Two very different LENR experiments exhibited daily variations in their characteristics or outputs. Comparison of the variations for the experiments forces the conclusion that the measured variations are artifactual. That is, they are not due to the influence of an external diurnal mechanism such as cosmic rays. However, the causes of the observed variations are not understood. Such understanding is important for the conduct of robust LENR experiments to obtain credible data. It is also critical to the reliable operation of eventual LENR power sources.",,,,,,

"As a result of the empirical knowledge now in hand, it is not unreasonable to imagine safe and green sources of nuclear power for homes, free of carbon emissions, which also will relieve stress on the power grid, because they might be small and distributed. LENR could be the basis for portable nuclear power sources, maybe even batteries. The production of clean drinking water by desalination or by purification of polluted river waters is one of the many, and perhaps the most attractive potential applications of LENR. The world health implications of clean water would be momentous. Those of us who work on the Fleischmann-Pons Effect find it an exciting and challenging field of research with remarkable practical potential. As a scientific effect, it is already historic. It remains to be seen if it will turn out to be a ""game changing"" practical source of energy. The field is indeed EXCITING NEW SCIENCE and it offers POTENTIAL CLEAN ENERGY.",,,,,,

"Sixty years of research on hot fusion have cost more than $ 20 B. Only one of the dozens of experiments has barely reached breakeven, the point at which the energy produced is equal to the energy spent for its production. Twenty years of work on ""cold fusion"" cost less than $ 0.2 B. Energy amplifications exceeding 10 for the palladium-deuterium system, and more than 100 for the nickel-hydrogen system, have been reported, but not verified. Hot fusion is understood and may result in large power plants in several decades. ""Cold fusion"", now called Low-Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR), remains a scientific mystery. If adequately funded, LENR could lead to safe, non-radioactive, green, small, distributed nuclear energy sources in less than two or three decades, well before hot fusion can produce commercial power.",,,,,,

The craters vary widely in shape and areal distribution. Two methods were used to determine the energies needed to produce such craters. The resulting energies range from nJ to mJ, depending on the crater size. If craters are caused by LENR, then many nearly simultaneous MeV-level energy releases would have to occur in a very small volume. There are numerous open basic questions regarding the formation and characteristics of craters in LENR cathodes. It remains to be seen if craters will be helpful in understanding the origin and nature of LENR. But already, the existence and features of craters seriously challenge theories that seek to understand LENR.",,,,,,

"Some theories of the mechanisms active in producing Lattice Enabled (or Low Energy) Nuclear Reactions (LENR) predict the formation of compact objects with binding energies and sizes intermediate between those of atoms and nuclei. The existence of compact objects remains unproven. But, if such objects exist and are formed during what are now called LENR experiments, they might release substantial energy without any nuclear reactions. Because of the small size of hypothetical compact objects, it is thought that the protons or deuterons at their centers might subsequently participate in nuclear reactions, producing more energy, transmutation products or energetic quanta. Such a two-step sequence could explain the relatively low production rates of nuclear reaction products, and also difficulties in correlating excess heat with the amounts of such products.",,,,,,

"The rapid release of energy from Lattice Enabled (or Low Energy) Nuclear Reactions is of interest for three reasons. First, it constrains and challenges theories about the mechanism(s) active in producing LENR. Next, it might heavily influence the design of heat and electrical generators based on LENR, since they have to be safe for use by a wide variety of people. Finally, there has long been interest in whether or not LENR could be used to augment existing weapons or produce to entirely new weapons. This paper first reviews reports in the literature of meltdowns or explosions that might have been caused by LENR. Then, each of the three areas cited above is examined. It is clear that reported high energy or high power events will heavily impact theories about LENR and the development of safe products. It is unclear now if LENR will be weaponized in any form. Control of the initiation of explosive LENR events is obviously necessary for that possibility.",,,,,,

"An objective of this report is to remove doubt about measured results from Low Energy Nuclear Reaction (LENR) experiments, even though the mechanisms that produce LENR are not fully understood. The report demonstrates that there is much reputable evidence in available technical records, which shows LENR devices are capable of producing energy. It has been demonstrated experimentally and often that chemical energies can produce nuclear reactions. Significant energy gains are possible. The ""excess heat"" found by Fleischmann and Pons has attractive features. They include low levels of prompt and residual radiation, and no production of green house gases. Reaction by-products, such as tritium or helium, are also generated. They can only result from nuclear reactions. Low Energy Nuclear Reactions have great practical potential.",,,,,,

"The mechanisms that cause Lattice Enabled (or Low Energy) Nuclear Reactions (LENR) are still not understood, even though much is known empirically about LENR. We provide list of 24 observations from almost three decades of LENR experiments. These observations require theoretical explanations. This paper deals with two aspects of the many theories about the mechanisms. The first is the theories themselves, i.e., their characteristics and results. The few dozen available theories on LENR mechanisms are diverse and complex. Only a lengthy paper could properly summarize their essence, including all assumptions and implications. Such a thorough review of extant LENR theories would be challenging to write. Here, we merely indicate reviews and other sources of information on LENR theories. The second focus of this paper is the status of development of LENR theories, specifically, the completeness of their elaboration. It is possible to detail what is expected of LENR theorists by experimentalists, teachers, students, developers and other interested personnel. We provide and discuss ten questions for LENR theoreticians about the description (characteristics) and status (development) of their ideas. The nearly three decades of theoretical work on LENR has resulted in remarkably few well-developed theories. None of them has yet been adequately tested and widely accepted. There remains a great opportunity for some theoretician to provide the basic understanding of LENR. That understanding would enable or speed the commercialization of this new, clean, promising and much needed energy source.",,,,,,

"Our previous reports based on theoretical considerations and supercomputer simulation showed the possibility that super multi-air jets of gases such as air or deuterium colliding with pulse (K. Naitoh, patent: 2012-519298 (2010)) lead to self-compression over 60 MPa and 2000 K at single point around the reacted center, at maximum. This may bring about a more stable occurrence of cold fusion. This approach due to supermulti-jets will also cause an insulation effect because of encasing, which will result in less heat loss from the reactor walls. Based on this, we developed three types of prototype engine reactors using the supermulti-jets colliding with pulse. In the present report, we show some fundamental experimental data for one of the three prototype engine reactors, derived now, before we plan to begin testing for cold fusion.",,,,,,

We examine the anti-Zeno effect as a model of a barrier of a special shape, which is similar to the form of barriers to nuclear fusion in a solid, and moreover, has an analytic solution. We have deduced formulas that demonstrate conditions that increase the barrier permeability. Numerical estimates of the particle flows through the barrier are carried out for the conditions of cold fusion experiments.",,,,,,

"In the period 1978–2002, The Silcal Metallurgic Ltd., a Coimbatore (India) based company, was engaged in the production of ferro silicon alloy deploying a 12 MVA ""Submerged Carbon Arc"" powered smelter. During a 11-week long non-stop round the clock operation of the plant in 1995, daily feed of raw materials was: Quartz (33.4 ton), charcoal (with fixed carbon content of 13.2 ton) and scrap steel (5.1 ton) while the daily output production of Fe–Si alloy (73.5% Si) was 24.75 ton. From the total weights of Si and Fe in the input feed and assuming 100% recovery of the metals, the daily output alloy production could at best have been only 20.5 ton. However to our surprise throughout the 11-week period the total daily Fe–Si alloy (with 73.5% Si) output was consistently 24.75 ton, corresponding to a daily ""anomalous"" excess metal production of 4.25 ton of Fe–Si alloy. The only source of Si entering the smelter furnace was the quartz raw material and that of Fe was the scrap steel (except for minor additional amounts of Fe originating from the steel casing of the consumable Söderberg carbon electrodes). Very careful vigil of the weights of daily input feed of raw materials and output alloy drained out as also the electrical energy consumption was maintained. It was evident that roughly 20% more metal than could be accounted for from the input feed was being produced and consequently we have been obliged to come to the conclusion that anomalous quantities of Si (2.8 ton/day) and Fe (1.45 ton/day) were being synthesized during the smelting process. Discussions with researchers involved in the Cold Fusion/LENR field have suggested that a likely explanation for the anomalous metal production could be the occurrence of transmutation reactions between nuclei of C and the O stripped from the SiO2 during the chemical reduction process. It is speculated that the intense varying magnetic fields generated by the kilo-amp levels of alternating current (AC) driving the arcing between the three gigantic carbon electrodes and the carbonic hearth of the furnace, in the 2000?C temperature environment, could have somehow catalyzed transmutation reactions to occur, very similar to the transmutations reported in laboratory scale ""Carbon-Arc experiments"" first revealed by George Oshawa in 1964. But the more puzzling aspect of our observations is that there was no evidence of release of the expected massive amounts of nuclear energy that should have accompanied the postulated transmutation reactions based on the atomic masses of the nuclei involved.",,,,,,

It was assumed that a nuclear reaction took place during the experiment, producing short-lived radioisotopes, and these radioisotopes emitted the gamma rays in their decay processes. Elements and their isotopic abundance on the palladium cathodes were investigated by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry to find evidence of a nuclear reaction.",,,,,,

We also employed a continuous wave He-Ne laser to irradiate the samples inside the chamber during the treatment, in order to increase the gas absorption. Using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and an electron probe micro-analyzer (EDX), we observed structures like spots on the surface of the treated samples. Inside the spots, elements other than Pd were found. Based on these results, we determined that gas loading is an effective way to transmute elements, and the laser action has been a very effective way to increase morphological changes in the treated samples.",,,,,,

"Clusters of H isotope atoms segregated to vacancies, divacancies and vacancy–impurity complexes in FCC metals are proposed as fuel for low energy nuclear reactions (LENR). Such clusters combine extremely high H atomic density, large values of screening potential, and as a result, a low LENR ignition energy in eV region. Besides, high average H density can be achieved due to the superabundant vacancy state (SAV) formation. These conclusions are made based on the density functional theory (DFT) modeling of these clusters, estimations of the nuclear reaction rates using experimental data for the nuclear reaction cross sections and a wide set of experimental studies of charging and recharging of various Ni samples with H and D atoms. The results were analyzed using temperature programmed desorption. The experiments confirmed extremely high loading of Ni samples with H isotopes. We discuss the problem of suitable ignition mechanisms and sustainability conditions.",,,,,,

"The relatively low/medium proton/carbon collision threshold energy (1–8 keV) of the Bethe–Weizsäcker nuclear reaction cycle C, N, and O observed in low temperature carbon rich stars suggests the eventual technical feasibility of a solid-state carbon fusion reactor. H+ used as a precursor nuclear material can be implanted in solid-state carbon material. We must then consider all effects that can affect nuclear collision efficiency, including solid-state structure specificity, proton channeling and the reduction of the original proton energy with electronic interactions, before looking at the possible nuclear reactions themselves. We then have to consider the different effects and types of atomic rearrangement favoring either sp2 or sp3 sites or which influence the carbon material structure. For this purpose, we review first a recently developed theoretical approach, which might explain important aspects of this phenomenon with still high confidence up to now. These aspects include quantum electronic activation especially with H2 recombination energy release, which is different from usual chemical and metallurgical thermal atomic rearrangement with which an optimized ta-C sp3 carbon structure can be controlled. It should also be considered that carbon structure determination methodology – including the recently revised Raman theory – provide more correct and accurate results. To be falsified a study of this type of proton–carbon nuclear reactor must also take into account effects which modify the carbon nucleus structure in favor of nuclear fusion. It is suggested that anharmonic synchronic phonon–nuclear resonance may be a contributing factor. However, present failures and the limits of abstract Quantum Mechanical formalism bring little clarification on this last point, which we suggest is owing to insufficient physical description of particle wave character. In order to improve these aspects of the theory, we suggest revisiting aether theory which with further investigation and development of 3D fluid mechanics is expected to account for all QM acquired, and to be able to provide clearer physical insight into the subatomic particle wave aspects and corresponding nuclear reaction mechanism.",,,,,,

"Replication of experiments claiming to demonstrate excess heat production in light water-Ni-K2CO3 electrolytic cells was found to produce an apparent excess heat of 11 W maximum, for 60 W electrical power into the cell. Power gains ranged from 1.06 to 1.68. The cell was operated at four different dc current levels plus one pulsed current run at 1 Hz, 10% duty cycle. The 28 liter cell used in these verification tests was on loan from a private corporation whose own tests with similar cells are documented to produce 50 W steady excess heat for a continuous period exceeding hundreds of days. The apparent excess heat can not be readily explained either in terms of nonlinearity of the cell's thermal conductance at a low temperature differential or by thermoelectric heat pumping. However, the present data do admit efficient recombination of dissolved hydrogen-oxygen as an ordinary explanation. Calorimetry methods and heat balance calculations for the verification tests are described. Considering the large magnitude of benefit if this effect is found to be a genuine new energy source, a more thorough investigation of evolved heat in the nickel-hydrogen system in both electrolytic and gaseous loading cells remains warranted.",,,,,,

"Microbiological soil improvers have a potential as a tool for regulation transfer of induced radioisotopes and other pollutants into crops. During the development of a method using effective microorganisms (EM) to reduce the soil-to-plant transfer of 137Cs on land contaminated with radioactive cesium, an unexpected effect of EM on the reduction of the 137Cs activity in soil samples was observed. Laboratory experiments were then conducted to evaluate the impact of EM and fermented organic fertilizer (EM Bokashi) on the 137Cs activity in soil samples to investigate this observation. The experimental results indicate an increase in the 137Cs decay rate of up to 4 times the usual decay rate corresponding to the half-life of 137Cs, which is 30.17 years. Our results suggest that EM accelerates the radioactive decay of 137Cs in soil.",,,,,,

"A problem popularly known as ""cold fusion"" was brought, although in an unusual way, to the attention of the scientific community. Although much discussion was (and is still) devoted to whether this effect is connected with any known nuclear reactions, the latter being widely questioned, there is no doubt that the general interest in the problem was provoked by the claim of the possibility of producing excess energy, i.e., energy surmounting the energy breakeven value. Unlike the clearly negative indications so far in terms of known nuclear processes taking place, however, careful analysis reveals that the claims in the principal negative papers published so far with respect to the existence of excess energy are in disagreement with the raw experimental data whenever such is presented in those papers. This is very surprising indeed in view of the wide publicity these negative results have been given. An example of an improper analysis of their own experimental data by the authors is Ref. 1, which we have already discussed. Other examples of inappropriate method and improper interpretation of their own experimental data are Refs. 3 and 4.",,,,,,

"It was confirmed experimentally that some nuclei products of cold fusion were generated during electrolysis by use of cathodes of poorest nickel and platinum eyes platinum in light (usual) water solutions of all alkali metallic ions investigated. He also reported in the previous work that 4 ppm of calcium was detected in the electrolyte of potassium carbonate light water solution by flame photospectroscopy. The gamma ray measurement revealed the formation of 24Na during electrolysis in sodium carbonate solution. ICP mass spectra of an electrolyte of cesium sulfate solution showed several peaks of the various nuclear products in the region from 132 to 140 amu. In all electrolytes investigated, the distinct increments of tritium were measured by liquid scintillation spectroanalyzer. Simultaneously the excess heat was measured in the family open cell during electrolysis in these solutions of light or heavy water, which amounted to > 200% for the input power in potassium and cesium ion solutions. From these results we can conclude that the alkali intermetallic compounds formed as the intermediate of hydrogen evolution reaction cause many types of cold fusion with neutrons, protons, deuterium, tritium and alpha particles.",,,,,,

Long-term electrolysis for well annealed thick Pd rods (9.0 and 21.2 mm diameter) in 0.1 M LiOD have been performed to examine anomalous phenomena; neutron emission and heat bursts. The count rate of neutron (CRN) bunched for 3 h showed no significant increase at low current densities. High CRN appeared a few days later after the current increased to 102.4 mA/cm2 and the temperature was raised to 50°C. In two experiments CRN and neutron energy spectrum of 2.45 MeV was reproduced.,,,,,,

"The physico-chemical properties of hydrogen in Pd have been studied by in situ potentio, resisto and dilatometric measurement. A set of potential, resistance ratio and increase of dilation . . . was recorded simultaneously after the establishment of an equilibrium of hydrogen with Pd lattice. The hydrogen electrode potential is converted to 'equivalent hydrogen pressure', which might signify gaseous pressure in a void or on a surface. The structural phase transition (alpha -> beta) occurred during the cathodic discharging of hydrogen and the characteristic values of this phase change are well consistent with those predicted from Pd-H diagram. Hydrogen infusion causes lattice expansion, which resulted in the dilation of Pd electrode. Repeated absorption and desorption cycle deteriorates the mechanical properties, where the hysteresis of RIRo vs. hydrogen pressure diagram was appeared depending on the mode of electrolysis(the extent of H/Pd ratio).",,,,,,

"Deuteron beam implantation experiments have been carried out for the examination of the hypothesized new class of fusion reactions to explain the Fleischmann-Pons effect. Some additional techniques were introduced in the implantation experiments by considering the effects of temperature change, pulsed-current stimulation and molecular ion beam. Energetic charged particles from the Ti and Pd foils implanted with lOO-2S0keV deuteron beams were measured with Si-SSDs. In some of the experiments, unusual counts were observed in the energy region higher than the proton peClk of the well-known D-D reaction, and they might be related to the new class of fusion reactions with large Q-values. However statistics of the counts were too poor to identify the types of their original reactions. More detailed and longterm measurements are necessary for the explanation of the unusual counts in the high energy region.",,,,,,

As a result of the experiments, helium-3 (4.75 MeV) and triton(4.75 MeV) from 3D-fusion proposed by new class of fusion theory in solid[I-3] were repeatedly observed. We identified the two unique charged particles as products of the reaction channel of 3D -> t + 3He + 9.5 MeV by the combinational analyses of one-dimensional and two-dimensional data. Experimentally obtained 3D fusion rate was in the order of 10^3 f/s that was surprisingly large value and was enhanced about 10^26 times, compared with the traditional theory of D-D reaction process.",,,,,,

"Deuterium loading ratios in the electrolytic palladium cathodes are measured by the electric resistance method. Many kinds of palladium rod are prepared and their loading ratios are determined during our standard electrolysis procedure. Some palladium cathodes are provided with additional treatments to change surface conditions. As the results, it is found that the deuterium loading ratio is very sensitive to palladium surface conditions. For example, when a palladium sample of which surface is modified by aqua regia, the loading ratio as high as DIPd ~ 0.95 is obtained at 200 mNcm^2 of electrolytic currents, which can hardly be achieved with an ordinary palladium cathode rod.",,,,,,

"The claims of Mizuno and collaborators, and the earlier claims of Biberian and Forrat, that excess thermal power can be developed by proton-conducting oxides held in deuterium gas at elevated temperatures are important because thermal power generated at high temperatures can be converted to other forms of power with greater Carnot efficiency than thermal power at lower temperatures. Therefore, a Seebeck calorimeter operating at 400°C was constructed to attempt to verify these claims. This calorimeter, whose operation is independent of the spatial distribution of power sources and of the thermal conductivity of the gas, is described. . . .",,,,,,

"We show that energetic charged particles are produced during electrolysis of a D2O solution of Li2SO4 in a cell with a platinum anode and a palladium cathode. CR-39 plastic detectors, designed for recording alpha particles from radon decay, were immersed in the electrolyte during electrolysis. They recorded significantly larger numbers of energetic particle tracks than were recorded by control detectors not subject to electrolysis. Statistical analysis shows only a 3 * 10^-6 probability that the electrolysis tracks and the control tracks could have arisen from a common population. We conclude that there is a causal relationship between electrolysis and the production of energetic charged particles. Because track formation requires particle energies substantially greater than thermal or electrochemical energies it seems inescapable that a nuclear reaction was responsible.",,,,,,

"By the use of Cr-39 particle track detectors immersed in the electrolyte, we confirm that a nuclear reaction of as-yet unknown nature can take place during electrolysis. With Li2SO4 dissolved in D2O or H2O and either Pd or Ni as cathodes, a very large statistical difference in nuclear track generation is found between detector chips immersed during electrolysis and the control chips immersed in similar solutions not subjected to electrolysis. The probability that the electrolysis tracks and the control tracks could have by chance arisen from a common population is 2.5 x 10^-5, 1.2 x 10^-6, and 5.8 x 10^-4 for the systems Pd/D2O, Pd/H2O, and Ni/D2O, respectively. We conclude that there is a causal relationship between electrolysis and energetic charged particles and that neither Pd nor D2O is essential for the generation of a nuclear reaction. Some implications for theoretical considerations are presented.",,,,,,

"CR-39 plastic detector chips suspended in the vapor over the electrolytic solution during electrolysis record the tracks of highly energetic charged particles. The probability that the track densities found in these detector chips and the generally smaller track densities found in controls belong to a common population is 3 x 10^-10 by the Mann-Whitney statistical test. It is therefore concluded that a nuclear reaction that originates in the vapor phase can accompany electrolysis. Occasionally huge numbers of nuclear tracks are recorded by detector chips in the vapor over active electrolysis cells. One such experiment is analyzed in which two contiguous detector chips recorded approximately 40,000 tracks. Analysis of track orientations shows that the shower of charged particles originated in a compact source in the vapor between the chips at about 2 mm from one of the chips. A new type of nuclear reaction is indicated.",,,,,,

Because CR-39 detectors record only particles with energies in excess of about 0.2 MeV the detected particles must have arisen in nuclear reactions. Evidence for such reactions was found in deuterium gas behind a palladium cathode that served as part of the cell enclosure, in air behind a similarly disposed nickel cathode, in air beyond the glass wall of the electrolysis cell, and in oxygen gas above the anode when anode and cathode were placed in separate arms of a U-tube cell. These results, augmented by earlier work indicating nuclear reactions within the electrolyte and in the hydrogen-oxygen gas over the electrolyte, cannot be understood in terms of conventional nuclear theory.",,,,,,

"Past work in this laboratory has shown that nuclear particles generated during electrolysis can be registered by CR39 plastic detectors held within the electrolyte solution, suspended in the vapor above the solution, or placed just below the metal cathode that serves as the bottom of the electrolyte compartment of the electrolysis cell. However, not every electrolysis experiment produced nuclear particles so that total reproducibility was not achieved. Therefore another experimental technique has been developed which has shown the generation of nuclear particles in each of twenty five consecutive electrolysis experiments using heavy or light water solutions of lithium salts. The damage trails caused by the nuclear particles are made visible by etching in hot concentrated caustic solution, and the electrolysis experiments are accompanied by suitable blank, or control, experiments. The damage trails begin either at the surface of the CR39 chip that faces toward the electrolyte, at the opposite surface, or totally within the 0.83 mm thickness of the plastic detectors. It is demonstrated that the nuclear damage trails could not have been caused by ordinary radionuclides contaminating anything involved in the experimental procedure. The described phenomena pose a formidable challenge to nuclear theory.",,,,,,

"CR39 plastic detectors for nuclear particles are employed to demonstrate that a nuclear reaction can accompany electrolysis, an electrochemical process. Detectors placed within or above the electrolyte display statistically greater numbers of nuclear pits than do detectors used as controls. Placing the cathodes in contact with Mylar-covered detectors is the basis for a technique that reproducibly generates evidence for a nuclear reaction during electrolysis. Nuclear pits are produced in plastic detectors exposed to the oxygen evolved at the anode, as well as to the hydrogen evolved at the cathode. Nuclear damage trails are found that are initiated within the 0.83mm thickness of the plastic detectors. These phenomena clearly show that a nuclear reaction of as yet unknown nature can be generated during electrolysis.",,,,,,

There is an energy offset of about 100 meV in the calculation as compared to experiment. We developed an empirical correction to the theoretical energies which allowed us to fit the experimental results for excess enthalpy and excess entropy with some success. We also explored a new model that posits a weak binding between absorbed hydrogen atoms in PdH, and is able to provide a better fit to the experimental results. The model provides a simple physical explanation of observed phase diagram, and also of the observed dependence of the thermodynamic variables (excess enthalpy and excess entropy) on loading.",,,,,,

"Abstract: Brian Josephson appealed at the meeting of the Nobel Laureates July 2004 against the ignorance of physicist to the phenomenon of cold fusion. Though there are good reasons against many publications to this topic but not to all what was reported. It seems to be indicated to summarize the following serious, reproducible and confirmed observations on reactions of protons or deuterons incorporated in host metals such as palladium, nickel and other metals. We underline the confusing discovery by Cockroft and Oliphant with the anomalously low energy for nuclear reactions which was hundred times lower than in the usual cases when smashing nuclei against their Coulomb potential. A similar unexpected result was that of Otto Hahn’s-the chemist!-discovery of fission that had changed the world. A significant result for cold fusion was seen in gaseous atmosphere or discharges between palladium targets, rather significant and fully reproducible, e.g. from the ""life after death"" heat production of such high values per host atom that only nuclear reactions can be involved. This supports the earlier evaluation of neutron generation in fully reversible experiments with gas discharges hinting that a reasonable screening effect-preferably in the swimming electron layer-may lead to reactions at nuclear distances d of picometers with reaction probability times U of about megaseconds similar to the K-shell capture radioactivity. Further electrolytic experiments led to Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR) where the involvement of pollution could be excluded from the generation of very seldom rare earth elements. A basically new theory for DD cross sections is used to confirm the picometer-megasecond reactions of cold fusion. Other theoretical aspects are given from measured heavy element distributions similar to the standard abundance distribution, SAD, in the Universe with consequences on endothermic heavy nuclei generation, magic numbers and to quarkgluon plasmas. One application may be the elimination of long lived nuclear waste by transmutation into stable nuclei.",,,,,,

"The heat balances of the heavy water electrolysis by Pd were measured in the closed cell. The excess heat with burst was observed three times out of 13 runs when mechanically treated Pd cathodes were used in 1 M LiOD solution. One of these was for Pd-Ag alloy (90:10) which began at 1,155 h after the start of the electrolysis, lasting for 240 h. The average output power was 105% of the input during that time. The integrated excess heat was calculated to be 185 MJ per cubic centimeter of palladium. In this case the maximum excess power was recorded for this Pd.",,,,,,

The heat balance during the electrolysis of 1M LiOD heavy water solution using Pd cathode has been measured using the flow calorimeter with the constant power supply and the thermochemically closed cell. The special attention was paid on the concentration of B in the palladium cathode. The B concentration was controlled from 127 to 1000 ppm.,,,,,,
"Using Pd that contained 127ppm and 1000ppm B, the excess heat was not observed. While, using Pd that contained 267ppm and 500ppm B, the small excess heat was observed at 3 runs out of 5 runs. The excess heat appeared continuously from the beginning of the electrolysis. These concentration of B might be effective for the excess heat generation.",,,,,,

A clear difference in absorption, desorption and depth profiles between LiOD(H) and NaOD(H) or KOD(H) system with the pulse mode current electrolysis is identified.

"The in-situ electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) technique has been applied to study electrolysis of water containing 0.2 M LiClO4 at Pd cathode. Decrease in resonant frequency was observed during the electrolysis. The decrease was attributed to the mass change involving hydrogen absorption into the palladium and lithium underpotential deposition, the mechanical stress change in the electrode, and the change in roughness of the electrode surface. The stress change, which may be caused by hydrogen uptake, was estimated using palladium film-coated AT- and BT-cut quartz crystal oscillators. The surface roughness change was observed by scanning electron microscopy and a number of cracks and holes were found. Underpotential deposition of lithium was observed in propylene carbonate containing 0.1 M LiClO4 and 16 mg L^-1 water.

"Highly sensitive calorimetry was carried out to assess excess heat production in the presence of sulfur ion (S^ 2-) in electrolyte solutions. Electrolysis of a D20 solution containing IOmM S^2- produced ""burst-like"" excess heat up to 14% over 12 hours after 6 days' electrolysis. The production of excess heat was absent from a control experiment using LiOH/H2O in the place of LiOD/D2O. It seemed that the magnitude and reproducibility of the excess heat production were improved by the addition of S^2- to the electrolyte solutions. In this study, in situ observations of topographic changes at electrode surfaces during the electrolysis were also conducted using phase measurement interferometric microscopy (PMIM). The absorption of hydrogen into a Pd cathode was clearly seen to bring about surface roughening even at a very low hydrogen content of less than H/Pd=0.005. Original surface topography was readily restored by desorbing hydrogen from the Pd electrode by using it as the anode. The absorption and desorption of deuterium similarly induced the reversible surface topography change. The extent of the surface roughening due to the hydrogen absorption varied with electrode materials and crystal facets of Pd single crystals.",,,,,,

"In this paper, we look into the difficult question of electron deep levels in the hydrogen atom. An introduction shows some general considerations on these orbits as ""anomalous"" (and usually rejected) solutions of relativistic quantum equations. The first part of our study is devoted to a discussion of the arguments against the deep orbits and for them, as exemplified in published solutions. We examine each of the principal negative arguments found in the literature and show how it is possible to resolve the questions raised. In fact, most of the problems are related to the singularity of the Coulomb potential when considering the nucleus as a point charge, and so they can be easily resolved when considering a more realistic potential with finite value inside the nucleus. In the second part, we consider specific works on deep orbits as solutions of the relativistic Schrödinger and of the Dirac equations, named Dirac Deep Levels (DDLs). The latter presents the most complete solution and development for spin1 /2 particles, and includes an infinite family of DDL solutions. We examine particularities of these DDL solutions and more generally of the anomalous solutions. We next analyze the methods for, and the properties of, the solutions that include a corrected potential inside the nucleus, and we examine the questions raised by this new element. Finally, we indicate, in the conclusion, open questions such as the physical meaning of the relation between quantum numbers determining the deep levels and the fact that the angular momentum seems two orders-of-magnitude lower than the values associated with the Planck constant. As a prerequisite to a deep comprehension of the resolution methods, we recall in the appendices some essential elements of the Dirac theory.",,,,,,

"This work continues our previous works on electron deep orbits of the hydrogen atom. An introduction shows the importance of the deep orbits of hydrogen (H or D) for research in the LENR domain, and gives some general considerations on the Electron Deep Orbits (EDOs). In a first part we quickly recall the known criticism against the EDO and how we face it. In particular, a solution to fix all problems is to consider a modified Coulomb potential with finite value inside the nucleus. For this reason, we deeply analyzed the specific work of Maly and Va’vra on deep orbits as solutions of the Dirac equation, with such a modified Coulomb potential without singular point. Then, by using a more complete ansatz, we made numerous computations on the wavefunctions of these EDOs, allowing to confirm the approximate size of the mean radii ?r? of orbits and to find further properties. Moreover, we observed that the essential element for obtaining deep orbits solutions is special relativity. At a first glance, this fact results from an obvious algebraic property of the expression of energy levels obtained by the relativistic equations. Now, a comparative analysis of the relativistic and of the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation allows us to affirm that Special Relativity leads to the existence of EDOs because of the non-linear form of the relativistic expression for the total energy, which implies a relativistic non-linear correction to the Coulomb potential.",,,,,,

In the second part, we consider the specific work of Maly and Va’vra on deep orbits as solutions of the Dirac equation, the so-called Deep Dirac Levels (DDLs). As a result of some criticism about the matching conditions at the boundary, we verified their computation, but by using a more complete ansatz for the ""inside"" solution. We can confirm the approximate size of the mean radii ?r? of DDL orbits and that ?r? decreases when the Dirac angular quantum number k increases. This latter finding is a self-consistent result since (as distinct from the atomic-electron orbitals) the binding energy of the DDL electron increases (in absolute value) with k. We observe that the essential element for obtaining deep orbits solutions is special relativity.",,,,,,

"In the previous works, we discussed arguments for and against the deep orbits, as exemplified in published solutions. So we considered the works of Maly and Va’vra on the topic, the most complete solution available and one showing an infinite family of EDO solutions. In particular, we deeply analyzed their second of these papers, where they consider a finite nucleus and look for solutions with a Coulomb potential modified inside the nucleus. In the present paper, we quickly recall our analysis, verification, and extension of their results. Moreover, we answer to a recent criticism that the EDOs would represent negative energy states and therefore would not qualify as an answer to the questions posed by Cold Fusion results. We can prove, by means of a simple algebraic argument based on the solution process, that, while at the transition region, the energy of the EDOs are positive. Next, we deepen the essential role of Special Relativity as source of the EDOs, which we discussed in previous papers. But the central topic of our present study is an initial analysis of the magnetic interactions near the nucleus, with the aim of solving important physical questions: do the EDOs satisfy the Heisenberg Uncertainty relation (HUR)? Are the orbits stable? So, we examine some works related to the Vigier–Barut Model, with potentials including magnetic coupling. We also carried out approximate computations to evaluate the strength of these interactions and the possibilities of their answering some of our questions. As a first result, we can expect the HUR to be respected by EDOs, due to the high energies of the magnetic interactions near the nucleus. Present computations for stability do not yet give a plain result; we need further studies and tools based on QED to face the complexity of the near-nuclear region. For the creation of EDOs, we outline a possibility based on magnetic coupling.",,,,,,

"In previous works, we analyzed and countered arguments against the deep orbits, as discussed in published solutions. Moreover, we revealed the essential role of Special Relativity as source of electron deep orbits (EDOs). We also showed, from a well-known analytic method of solution of the Dirac equation, that the obtained EDOs have a positive energy. When including the magnetic interactions near the nucleus, we observed a breakthrough in how to satisfy the Heisenberg Uncertainty Relation (HUR) for electrons confined near the nucleus, in a radial zone of only a few fm. Here we chose a different method, by directly facing the HUR for such confined electrons, from which we deduce the coefficient ? of these highly relativistic electrons. Then we show the effective Coulomb potential due to a relativistic correction, can maintain the electrons in containment. Next we resume and deepen our study of the effects of EM interactions near the nucleus. We first obtain computation results: though approximate, we can effectively expect high-energy resonances near the nucleus. These results should be confirmed by using QFT-based methods.",,,,,,

"After analyzing, in the literature, deep orbit results of relativistic quantum equations, we studied them in a semi-classical way, by looking for a local minimum of total energy of an electron near the nucleus, while respecting the Heisenberg Uncertainty Relation (HUR). Now, while using new information thanks to semi-classical computations, we come back to deep electrons as solutions of the Dirac equation, to solve several important and subtle outstanding issues, such as the continuity of derivatives of wave functions, a spectral problem about the energy levels associated with the wave functions to compute, as well as essential relativistic and energy parameters of the solutions. We thus obtain a better completeness of the solutions. Finally, we give some approaches on the probability of the presence of Electron Deep Orbit (EDO) states in H atom.",,,,,,

ABSTRACT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"Three cells were electrolyzed in series at constant low current 42 days near a neutron detector of low background (40 counts/hr) using a protocol of adding boron and aluminum at 0.001 molar to the 0.1 molar LiOD electrolyte at ~18th day. Cathodes were loaded with deuterium at a few 10’s of milliamps/cm^2, with a 12-hour cryogenic treatment at day 17. Cathodes were sanded and replaced in the cell every 7 days. On the ~21st & 22nd days two successive fast neutron episodes were observed at about 2 times background. The neutron detector is minimally sensitive to gamma rays but gammas were observed near the end of the 20-hour neutron episode. When the cells were dismantled in late Sept 1992, all three cathodes (6 mm diameter x 60 mm long) were observed to be mildly radioactive. Analysis by germanium gamma detectors revealed presence of 100 billion atoms of Ag, Pd, Rh, and (one) Ru isotopes having ratios unlike those from bombardment by high-energy deuteron or proton beams.",,,,,,

"Over six years have elapsed since the first announcement by Fleischmann, Pons and Hawkins ( l ) of the observation of excess heat from palladium heavily loaded with deuterium. The EPRI program began in April, 1 989, and has continued to the present time attempting to replicate the claimed excess heat and determine its source. Under conditions difficult to achieve, some 16 separate experiments have successfully reached that goal out of some 35 major attempts. The conditions found necessary for an observation of excess heat were found to be at least three in number: 1) atomic loading ratio (DlPd) > -0.9; 2) Initiation time of 8 to 23 days; 3) current density >0. 1 amperes per cm^2 of cathode area. A fourth condition suggested by the results of a recent experiment is that the FLUX of deuterium across the palladium metal surface must be above some threshold value. No definitive source for the excess heat has been yet robustly determined, but measurable helium-4 has been observed in the cell vapor space in a few cases. The major evidence that the heat may be from nuclear reactions is its magnitude - some 10 to 100 times larger than any known chemical reaction. The objective of the continuing effort is focussed upon identifying the source of the excess heat. Sonic cavitation at a Pd-D2O interface has apparently produced both He-4 in the vapor phase as well as apparent excess heat. This research has identified a huge matrix of possible experiments to confirm or refute various hypotheses on the source of the heat. To acquire sufficient resources to explore this matrix requires, in my opinion, a definitive signature of a nuclear reaction connected with the production of heat. Then and only then, with the promise of a potential energy source of almost unlimited size, will the necessary research funds be forthcoming.",,,,,,

"Almost eight years have elapsed since the first announcement by Fleisclunann, Pons and Hawkins (1) of the observation of excess heat from palladium heavily loaded with deuterium. The EPRI program began in April, 1989, and has successfully confinned the presence of the claimed excess heat but has yet to determine its source. Measurable helium-4 has been observed in the cell vapor space in a few cases, but so far , not in a definitive manner. The major evidence that the heat may be from nuclear reactions is its magnitude - some 10 to 100 times larger than any known chemical reaction. The objective of the continuing effort is to identify the source of the excess heat. This paper focusses upon comparing measurements on cathodes that successfully produced excess heat with the same measurements on virgin material from the same batch of palladium. Initial measurements on one cathode that produced 0.56 megajoules of excess heat and its virgin counterpart are reported here. The analytical method chosen is a non destructive one known as prompt gamma activation analysis (PGAA) using thennal n~utrons in beams from research reactors. Since almost every isotope captures neutrons with the emission of several gamma rays unique to that isotope, any isotopic ratio changes from the heat production process will be converted to a change in the relative ratios of gamma ray intensities. Such ratios can be measured to an accuracy in the range around 1 % using high resolution gennanium detection systems. Thus any changes due to the production or loss of any isotope present can be detected and related to the excess heat produced. One such measurement using PGAA appears to show an -18% reduction in the ratio of boron-l 0 to palladium-l05 in the active cathode relative to the ratio in virgin material. Conventional explanations of this result such as selective chemical leaching of boron by the electrolyte are currently being tested.",,,,,,

"This paper compares measurements on cathodes that successfully produced excess heat with the same measurements on virgin material from the same batch of palladium. The analytical method used is known as prompt gamma activation analysis (PGAA) using a thermal neutron beam from a research reactor. Most isotopes capture neutrons with the emission of several unique gamma rays, so any isotopic ratio changes from heat production could change the ratios of gamma rays. Such ratios have been measured to an accuracy around 1% using germanium detectors. One such ratio is that of boron-10 to palladium-105. Boron is present in most Pd as an impurity up to several hundred PPM by weight. Significant depletion of the B-10 isotope has been observed in a number of cathodes relative to that in the virgin material. Conventional explanations of this result such as natural variation within a given batch are not yet resolved.",,,,,,

This is an experimental program to investigate possible trace element changes brought about in palladium (Pd) after extensive electrolysis in heavy water electrolytes as well as long time contact of particulate Pd with gaseous deuterium. Of particular interest are cathodes and particulate Pd which had experienced episodes of excess heat production beyond all electrical and other inputs. This paper details the careful analysis by neutron activation analysis (NAA) of a set of three samples of finely powdered Pd exposed to high deuterium pressures (hundreds of atmospheres) near room temperature at the core of hollow cylindrical Pd cathodes. A fourth sample of unused Pd powder from the same batch used in the cathodes was analyzed as a control. The most prominent change observed in the three active samples versus the virgin Pd was the Zn-64 content. The active samples showed an increase in the Zn-64 isotope of 6 to 14 times that in the virgin Pd. Speculation regarding the source of this increased zinc varies from contamination during electron beam welding (used to seal off the hollow core) to nuclear reactions generated by high pressure deuterium gas on the large surface area Pd particles in the core.,,,,,,

"Changes in Pd-110/Pd-108 ratios as well as the concentration of silver, gold, zinc, cobalt, iridium and lithium-7/6 ratios have been measured using neutron activation analysis (NAA) and Time of Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) on a set of four samples of particulate palladium exposed to high-pressure deuterium gas in the hollow core of Arata-Zhang cathodes. Three samples were from cathodes producing excess heat (10’s of megajoules) over a period of several-months electrolysis, while the fourth was virgin powder from the same batch as that of the active samples. If a nuclear process is the source of these changes, then multi-isotope elements such as silver, zinc, and iridium should show significant deviations in their isotopic ratios from the natural terrestrial values. Surface trace lithium did indeed show such differences from that of the virgin material. The Ag-109/107 ratio is currently under study by accelerator mass spectroscopy (AMS) for the one sample showing the greatest difference in Ag-109 content from that of the virgin material. Since these variations may have explanations unrelated to nuclear reactions, these results are not yet definitive. The 8% increase in the Pd-110/108 ratio for one of the four samples relative to the virgin material is one of the most difficult for which to find a conventional explanation.",,,,,,

"Evidence is cited from the research literature on metals containing absorbed deuterium supporting the hypothesis that the excess heat episodes observed over the past 25 years are the result of exothermic deuteron stripping reactions with atomic nuclei of the absorbing metal. The deuteron stripping reaction is one in which the neutron half of the mass 2 deuteron is captured by an atomic nucleus while the proton half of the deuteron is ejected, repelled by the coulomb field of the positively charged metal nucleus. This hypothesis provides a plausible explanation why so little external radiation accompanies the episodes of excess heat first observed by Fleischmann and Pons [1]. The reaction products from stable isotopes of the host metal are a proton with energies up to 9.2 MeV energy and a recoiling nucleus with energies of 100–to 600 keV. These two reaction products are retained near their birthplace because their range in solids is less than 100 m. The emitted proton is energetic enough to produce by (p,n), (p, ), (p,T), and (p,X-ray), reactions with host metal nuclei and their light-element impurities, the small number of neutrons, alpha particles, tritium atoms (T), and X-rays, occasionally observed associated with deuterated Ti and Pd. The PIXE process (proton induced X-ray emission) is expected in which numerous K, L, and M X-rays of the absorbing metal are produced. For metals with thicknesses of >1 mm the vast majority of such X-rays do not escape the metal. In experiments with foils of the host metal sufficiently thin, low levels of charged particles (mostly protons) have been observed. Some of the observed protons were at energies larger than 3.0 MeV, the largest possible energy of protons from the fusion of two deuterons. Widely observed He4 and tritium are known products of the deuteron stripping reaction with Li6, which is a major constituent of electrolytes and a minor impurity in most metals. In any case, researchers have observed small but definite indicators of nuclear reactions other than d+d fusion in deuterated metals at temperatures not significantly above ambient.",,,,,,

"Several theories to explain anomalous heat production predict the emission of low-energy X-rays and/or MeV alpha particles from PdD cathodes in electrochemical cells. Such radiation, however, is not detectable from outside of a standard electrochemical cell due to absorption in the electrolyte and cell walls. A custom cell was therefore assembled which permits X-rays of energy > 1 keV to pass through a thin cathodic membrane and enter into an X-ray detector with minimal attenuation. This test cell geometry also potentially allows any emitted MeV alpha particles to be detected when they impact a Pd cathode and cause fluorescent emission of Pd-K (21.2, 23.8 keV) X-rays. The detection of X-ray emissions from a membrane electrolytic cell potentially permits the mechanism(s) for anomalous heat production to be investigated with great sensitivity. As an example, a typical X-ray detector allows 1 keV X-rays to be detected at emission rates of less than one per second and this level of sensitivity corresponds to a thermal resolution of < 0.2 fW. Time resolved X-ray spectral data ranging from 1 to 30 keV was collected for over a year using various types of membranes and different electrolytic solutions. None of these test cells, however, yielded any X-rays which were above ambient background levels.",,,,,,

"The Fleischmann-Pons Effect [1] (FPE) was swiftly rejected when published in 1989, yet a significant number of researchers have since reported energy gains in similar experiments; for a review see ref. [2]. These gains have been associated with ""cold fusion"" or Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR) where energy is released from a deuterium-deuterium (d-d) fusion. Clearly, this raises fundamental questions because the probability of a d-d fusion, under the conditions of the FPE cell, is extremely small. As stated in ref. [1], ""it is necessary to reconsider the quantum mechanics of electrons and deuterons in such host lattices.""",,,,,,

"The purpose of this paper is to place side by side the experimental results of Piezonuclear reactions, which have been recently unveiled, and those collected during the last twenty years of experiments on low energy nuclear reactions (LENR). We will briefly report the results of our campaign of experiments on piezonuclear reactions where ultrasounds and cavitation were applied to solutions of stable elements. These outcomes will be shown to be compatible with the results and evidences obtained from low energy nuclear reaction experiments. Some theoretical concepts and ideas, on which our experiments are grounded, will be sketched and it will be shown that, in order to trigger our measured effects, it exists an energy threshold, that has to be overcome, and a maximum interval of time for this energy to be released to the nuclear system. Eventually, a research hypothesis will be put forward about the chance to raise the level of analogy from the mere comparison of results up to the phenomenological level. Here, among the various evidences collected in LENR experiments, we will search for hints about the overcome of the energy threshold and about the mechanism that releases the loaded energy in a suitable interval of time.",,,,,,

Therefore, we conclude that the renormalization of the energy of electromagnetic excitations (electrons, excitons, and phonons) is carried out by the residual strong nuclear interaction. The necessity to take into account the more close relation between quantum chromodynamics and quantum electrodynamics is underlined. In the first step quantum electrodynamics should take into account the residual strong interaction at the description of the dynamics of elementary excitations (electrons, excitons, and phonons) dynamics.",,,,,,

"The measurements of the dependence of the energy of strong nuclear interaction on the distance between nucleons in nucleus were performed for the first time. By the adding one neutron to hydrogen nucleus we enable the strong interaction. The initial components of mixed crystals LiHxD1-x are LiH (no strong interaction in the hydrogen nucleus) and LiD (with strong interaction in the deuterium nucleus) crystals are dielectrics with cubic symmetry. The change of the concentration of deuterium in mixed crystals LiHxD1-x determines the change in the distance between nucleons, which is directly manifested in the position of the phononless free exciton emission line in the low - temperature luminescence spectrum. A series of such measurements made it possible to construct a function of the dependence of the energy of strong nuclear interaction on the distance between nucleons in the deuterium nucleus.",,,,,,

It has therefore been necessary to adopt a low cost approach; our solution has been to use the single compartment Dewar cell type calorimeters illustrated in Fig. 1 and we have maintained up to five of these cells in each of three specially constructed water baths (see Section 1 below). The same type of calorimeter has been used for blank measurements on the Pd-H, Pt-D, and Pt-H systems.",,,,,,

"Abstract We have described elsewhere . . . that Pd and Pd-alloy electrodes cathodically polarised in D2O solutions under extreme conditions can drive the calorimetric cells to the boiling point. We have then adopted the procedure of allowing the cells to boil to dryness. For these conditions the galvanostats are driven to the rail voltage (100 V) but the cell current is reduced to zero. We have then found that cells which contained D2O frequently remain at high temperatures (in the vicinity of 100°C) before cooling rapidly to the bath temperature. Cells containing H2O can also be driven to the boiling point but such cells cool immediately on terminating the experiments. This phenomenon has become known as ""Heat after Death"" (the death referring to cessation of polarisation). Calibrations of the cells for such conditions show the generation of high levels of enthalpy at zero enthalpy input. Methods of investigating such systems will be outlined.",,,,,,

"During the summer of 1991, intense neutron bursts were observed after temperature shocking titanium chips which had been saturated with deuterium gas. The titanium chips were cooled and loaded with deuterium at 77 K and then rapidly heated to 323 K. The rapid heating produces a large pressure increase inside the crystalline lattice of the host metal. An Event Timer/Counter (ETC) card was designed and developed which counted and kept a time distribution of the neutron pulses as they occurred from a helium-3 neutron counter embedded in a paraffin moderator [1]. The experiment produced copious neutron counts. During one cooling and heating cycle, over 2 million neutrons were counted over a 5 min time period. In subsequent cooling and heating cycles using the same titanium chips, significant neutron bursts were observed with diminishing counts after each subsequent cycle. This paper will discuss the 1991 experiments and the status of ongoing experiments.",,,,,,

"The rapidly expanding experimental body of information on the phenomena attributed to cold nuclear fusion poses several funda.mental challenges to the generally accepted physical picture of both condensed matter and nuclear physics. In this presentation I will show how a recently proposed approach to the coherent electrodynamic processes in condensed matter, in terms of the 80 called ""superradiant"" behavior, can be used to provide for explicit coherent mechanism! for: (al greatly enhancing the tunneling probability in the DD fusion process; (b) ultrarapid electron cooling of the excited compound nucleus, thus strongly suppressing the usual n-3 He and p-T channels of DD fusion in vacuum.",,,,,,

"This talk will not be a summary of the theoretical contributions to this Conference: I think that the individual papers that this book collects can give a much better representation of the work that is now going on in the field than I can possibly attempt to give in a short talk. As a partial excuse I may quote a recent review article of mine, where I try to discuss the most significant theories of cold fusion, and the fact that nothing much new has happened in the last few months. Nor will I discuss cold fusion in the non-equilibrium. conditions prevailing in Titanium, fracto-emission and 'lukewarm' fusion.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"I shall rather try to examine first the strange facts of hydrogen incorporation into Palladium, and then I shall discuss the phenomena of cold fusion in relation to those facts. In the light of the known experimental data I will then discuss the general features of what we might call 'possible' and 'impossible' theories of cold fusion, somehow drawing a demarcation line between which theoretical ideas can and cannot explain those observations, given the well established and accepted general laws of condensed matter (Quantum Electro Dynamics, QED) and nuclear physics (Quantum Chromo Dynamics, QCD).",,,,,,

My discussion will follow quite closely a paper recently completed in collaboration with M. Fleischmann and S . Pons.,,,,,,

"Cavitation energy in a nearly evacuated bubble is shown to not likely reside in the thermal state of the water molecule. In a spherical bubble compression and until the bubble assumes a pancake collapse shape, a temperature increase does not occur in the bubble gas because the mean free path likely exceeds the bubble diameter. The subsequent collapse of the pancake shape to liquid density occurs with only a negligible volume change so that the temperature increase for compression heating of bubble gases is insignificant. Even near liquid density, a temperature increase does not occur as the energy transfer by molecular collisions is in the adiabatic limit for both vibrational and rotational modes. Instead, the IR radiation energy density present within the bubble is increased as required to satisfy standing wave boundary conditions with the bubble walls in the direction of collapse. For biological tissue in an opaque environment, bubble collapse is found to increase the 5- 10 micron I R thermal radiation at ambient temperature to about 3-5 e V that is capable of dissociating the water molecule and forming the chemically reactive hydroxyl radical. Hence, the biological effects of ultrasonic cavitation are proposed to be caused by the chemical reaction of the organisms with the excited electronic states of dissolved oxygen and water molecules.",,,,,,

"Experimental research and evaluation of three electrode (triode) cold fusion electrolysis cells is reported herein. Apparatus development began, after patent application, 05 June 1995. The triode apparatus introduces controlled loading and operation of Fleischmann/Pons-type (F/P) cells. In August 1995 excess heat generation was observed in initial triode apparatus experiments conducted by Dr. Dennis Cravens in his New Mexico laboratory. In November 1995 the Boiler Works laboratory in Diamondhead began experimental evaluation of the triode apparatus. A series of experiments in December, January and February led to development of a functioning triode fusion reactor. The reactor was put into operation 20 March 1996 and operated continuously until 23 August 1996. Over the five months of operation of the reactor several experiments were preformed and over 65,000 data pOints were recorded. This data base is being applied in further triode apparatus developments. . . .",,,,,,

"The possibility of D-D nuclear fusion in some deuterium-metal systems, under ambient conditions, has aroused feverish worldwide interest. Most of the work reported, so far, concerns deuterium charging of Pd metal through electrolysis of D2O. In the Chemistry Division, we have carried out some experiments on the deuteriding behaviour of Ti metal, through gaseous route, in the absorption as well as desorption modes, with the view to look for the fusion products, neutrons in the present case. These kinds of experiments have been reported by Frascatti Group in Italy. These authors detected neutron emission lasting over a period of several hours.",,,,,,

"We report an easily reproducible Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR) electrolysis experiment on an Ni–H system. An electrolytic cell with a Ni cathode and a Pt anode with an aqueous (H2O not D2O) solution of K2CO3 as electrolyte was used for the experiment. A dc-power supply capable of supplying up to 5 A current was used to drive the electrolysis with the typical current being around 4 A and the applied voltage about 100 V. After running the electrolysis for about two weeks with a daily run time of 8 h on an average, a part of the nickel electrode, which by this time had become black, was taken for elemental analysis using Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS). The EDS analysis showed that a whole host of new elements had appeared on the cathode such as: K, Fe, Cu, O, Rh, Zr and Pb. The apparent concentration of the elements varied from just over a percent for K and Pb to about 10% for Rh and 20% for Cu. The sample was then taken to a Time of Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometer (ToF-SIMS) for isotopic analysis. This analysis also showed that a set of new elements had appeared on the nickel wire which were: K, Si, Mg, Mn, Zn, O & Rh. The Ni itself was found to have the following isotopes: 58Ni, 60Ni and 62Ni with isotope concentration ratios differing significantly from the ratio found in naturally occurring Ni. It was clear that in the electrolyzed Ni the concentrations of 60Ni and 62Ni had gone down compared to the concentration of 58Ni. This is a clear indication that nuclear reactions had taken place during electrolysis.",,,,,,

Then it is shown that the model could account for the solar neutrino discrepancy.

By heating a TiT0.0035 preparation consisting of extremely small monocrystalline particles (diameter ≈ 15 nm) a decrease of the radioactivity by 40% was observed. In further experiments the concentration of tritium in such preparations was varied (TiTx experiments) showing that the radioactivity of the tritium increased less than proportionally to its concentration. Careful analysis of the experiments seems to rule out the possibility of trivial errors. A provisional hypothetical explanation is formulated. Our experiments may point to a connection with cold DD-fusion.,,,,,,

"In recent papers (1, 2, 3, 4) the author has deduced from experiments with tritium (5) that during heating of a TiT0.0035 -preparation and of a TiT0.0035-preparation the radioactivity of the tritium decreased strongly. This strange effect was distinctly confirmed by the observation that with the TiT0.0035-preparation the radioactivity decreased 12.5 times stronger than the release of tritium (2,3,4). A quite independent proof of the strong decrease of λ of tritium could be obtained by a thermodynamic evaluation of the heating experiment with the TiT0.0035-preparation: Assuming that λ of tritium decreases to zero or nearly zero in a part of the tritons enables the determination of the number of tritons with normal λ, nT and the number of tritons with λ ≈ 0 nTo, both as a function of temperature. Then quite surprising nT and nTo follow the laws of chemical equilibria in distinct parts of the experimental A = f(T)-function. From this unexpected result the decrease of tritium radioactivity is definitely proved once again (6).",,,,,,

In the case of models in which the electron is tightly bound to the H isotope atom, we show that states below the most deeply bound (-16.39 eV) are impossible in principle. We also present evidence against the possibility of the existence of electron-H isotope resonances.

"Rathke’s assertion [New J. Phys. 7 (2005) 127] that states with binding energy and size below those of known literature values are incompatible with quantum mechanics is corrected by reviewing the analytically known Coulomb solution of the Klein-Gordon equation with binding energy of order mc2 and size of order of the Compton wavelength. This is an example of a quantum state, which is mathematically acceptable in the sense of being square integrable and having a finite binding energy but yet is rejected as unphysical due in part to the point-nucleus nature of the model. Then the Dirac equation is studied for the existence of states which are similarly mathematically acceptable but whose physical acceptability requires physical judgment. States of Landau symmetry are found which meet these criteria. The existence of states of ambiguous physical interpretation for both the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations depends on using a point-nucleus versus a finite-nucleus potential model. On using a realistic model for the charge distribution of the proton, a Klein-Gordon state is found in the binding range of 5 keV, but no state is found for the Dirac equation.",,,,,,

"The long-established electron-capture reaction e- +p+ = n +? may be considered to be a prototype reaction in the nascent ?eld of physics known as low-energy nuclear reactions (LENR) since it involves an interface between electron and atomic physics (EAP) on the left-hand side and nuclear physics on the right-hand side of the reaction. It is a form of inverse beta decay n = p+ +e- +?, which is understood using a conceptual and mathematical methodology (forces mediated by the exchange of bosons known as force carriers and speci?cally for beta decay the W- boson as the force carrier for the electroweak force) which is totally foreign to EAP but well-supported by copious nuclear experimental data. Since no such established experimental database exists in LENR, an equation of motion (EOM) is proposed for the neutrino in analogy to Dirac’s equation, which is the EOM for the electron. The combined electron and neutrino EOM’s support temporary neutrino-electron binding and discover the mass and length scales of a nucleon on an ab initio basis. It is believed that the bound pair is a form of W boson, symbolized here by W± s for binding of a neutrino to a positron or electron (±) and for spin (s) equal to 0 or 1. It is also believed that W±s bosons may be useful as building blocks in constructing models in the LENR regime which may be physically equivalent to quarks and the known W± boson in the high-energy regime.",,,,,,

The introduction of a magnetic field perpendicular to the sample surface results in an increase in the tritium activity, and in the tritium generation rate, of almost two orders of magnitude as compared to similar experiments run with no magnetic field. The largest tritium generation rates observed were obtained with the glow discharge operating in a magnetic field, and were in the range 109-1010 atom/s. This is higher than our background by three to four orders of magnitude. The use of a magnetic field has resulted in good reproducibility, and the development of a reliable tritium generation rate of about 1010 atom/s for tantalum, tungsten, and platinum.",,,,,,

"From 1989 until his funding was terminated in 1995, Melvin Miles performed some of the best cold fusion experiments on record. His goal was to answer two critical questions: Does cold fusion produce helium along with excess heat, like a plasma fusion reaction? And if so, does it produce roughly as much helium per joule of energy as a plasma fusion reaction does? He answers both questions affirmatively. When a cold fusion palladium cathode becomes active, it releases helium into the electrolyte. The helium leaves the cell in the effluent deuterium and oxygen gas. Cathodes that produced more excess heat produced greater amounts of helium. The ratio of helium to energy is roughly comparable to that of hot fusion, within an order of magnitude. This is strong evidence that cold fusion really is some form of nuclear fusion, and not fission, zero point energy, or something else.",,,,,,

"Newspapers are indeed the first draft of history and, in many cases, the last draft as well. This has been one of the reasons behind cold fusion’s bad press over the years. Researchers made initial assessments of the phenomenon back in April 1989 and offered up their gut-reaction opinions to the media. Many of these erroneous, off-the-cuff ramblings are still widely quoted today. The three famous ""negative"" experiments at Caltech, MIT, and Harwell are often cited as proof that cold fusion does not exist, although careful reexaminations have subsequently shown that the tests conducted at all three establishments did, in fact, yield positive results. Reporters, commentators, and historians seldom look beyond immediate impressions formed in the earliest days of a major event, when confusion is rampant and detailed investigations have not yet begun. . . .",,,,,,

"Cold fusion will lower the cost of energy because the fuel costs nothing. It will also greatly reduce the cost of many machines, especially electric generators. The cost of generators is likely to fall by a factor of 200, from $2,000/kW to $10/kW, which is the cost difference between a power company central generator and a portable gasoline generator.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"A radical reduction in the cost of one device does not always reduce the cost of others. Since 1900, the cost of illumination has fallen by a factor of 80, but this has not directly reduced the cost of other goods and services by a similar factor. Since 1970, the cost of computer memory has fallen by a factor of 108. Microprocessors and cheap memory enhanced many products. They brought us the Internet and ubiquitous cheap computing. But so far they have not drastically lowered costs outside of computer applications. Cold fusion is different. All machines use energy, so cold fusion will lower the cost of everything, but it will have the biggest impact replacing large, expensive machines with small mass-produced versions. Other new sources of energy such as solar panels also have zero cost fuel, but they will not reduce the cost of other machines. Only cold fusion can do this.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"It follows that the most profitable use of cold fusion in the first decades after it is introduced will be to replace existing technology, rather than to make radical new technology. Microprocessors brought us machines we did not have, such as cell phones and the Internet. Cold fusion will — at first — dramatically lower the cost of machines we already have.",,,,,,

In 1996, Pons reported another series of experiments in which reactions up to 101 W were sustained continuously for up to 70 days with reflux calorimeters.",,,,,,

Cold fusion can eliminate the threat of global warming two ways:,,,,,,
,,,,,,
1. Cold fusion does not produce carbon dioxide so if it replaces other sources of energy carbon emissions would stop.,,,,,,
2. Cold fusion can enhance the removal of carbon from the atmosphere by reforestation.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"Large scale reforestation projects have been proposed to remove carbon from the atmosphere and sequester it in trees. Cold fusion technology would greatly enhance such projects, increasing the amount of carbon by a factor of ten and reducing the cost of the project by a large factor. Cold fusion can be used to stop the natural boom and bust cycle of forest carbon, by burying charcoal made from deadwood underground. In effect this would speed up the formation of coal by a factor of a million. Conventional energy sources cannot do this.",,,,,,

Cold fusion will lower the cost of energy because:,,,,,,

The fuel costs nothing.,,,,,,
Generators will be optimized for low cost.,,,,,,
It can be decentralized with no distribution grid.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"With a decentralized system, consumers will purchase their own home generator instead of using electric power company equipment. Subtracting the cost of power company equipment and fuel, and adding in the cost of the home generator, cold fusion should reduce the cost of energy by a factor of 21.",,,,,,

Emission of proton-like and neutron-like events was observed in the process of escaping deuterium from deuterized PdO-Pd-Ag and PdO-Pd-PdO samples. The ratio of the proton-like and neutron-like event fluxes was estimated as Np/Nn ~ 1.The charged particle emission was also observed in the process of escaping hydrogen from hydrogenized PdO-Pd-Ag and PdO-Pd-PdO samples. The emitted charged particles may be identified asprotons and a-particles. Investigation of charged-particle emission was carried out by 3 methods: (1) plastic scintillation counter; (2) Si-SSD; (3) CR-39 plastic track detector. The results obtained by these independent methods are in good agreement with each other.An effect of the weak thermal neutron flux on the processesof cold fusion in the samples loaded with D(H) was also investigated. It was observed that the flux of neutrons emitted from deuterized PdO-Pd-Ag samples exposed by thermal neutrons was approximately 300 times as large as in the case of unexposed samples.,,,,,,

"A 2-kJ Mather plasma focus device is used to deuterate the top end surface (or tip) of its central titanium electrode to investigate the occurrence of anomalous nuclear reactions in the context of the ""cold fusion"" phenomenon. The tip of the central titanium electrode is found to develop at least a few tens of microcuries of tritium after several plasma focus discharges. Neither the tritium impurity level in the deuterium gas used in the experiment nor the tritium branch of the d-d reactions that are known to occur in plasma focus devices can account for such activity in the electrode. Anomalous nuclear reactions in the deuterated titanium lattice appear to be the most probable source of this high activity.",,,,,,

The conditions of temperature and COP to achieve self-sustaining operation are given. According to the literature, the heat generation rate of some LENR processes increases rapidly with the temperature. This phenomenon dictates the cooling criteria to maintain a stable reactor operation. Power control can be obtained through appropriate temperature regulation. Several types of heat engines can be coupled to LENR reactors with appropriate power control. Heat losses must be minimized with sufficient thermal insulation. The insulation enclosure is also useful to recover the leaks of light gas, if any are present in the system.",,,,,,

"Hot spots are small features that some authors suppose are created by a sudden local release of thermal energy. For example, the estimation of the energy involved in the formation of a 2 µm crater is 3 × 10-8 J or 2 × 105 MeV. Some theories attempting to explain these phenomena, and excess heat in general, involve the role of Exotic Neutral Particles (ENP), like Polyneutrons or Erzions. According to such theories, these ENPs are relatively rare. The problem investigated in this paper is whether a single particle may trigger a series of many reactions within a short time in solids that are properly loaded. A Monte-Carlo simulation has been written to study the potential behavior of ENPs. It is shown that the ENPs follow a developed and Brownian type movement. The number of reactions occurring at a given depth below the surface is calculated, as well as the probability for a series to exceed a given value. From a pure mathematical viewpoint, a parallel can be made between the diffusion laws and Brownian motion. It is shown that a small fraction of the ENP flux can trigger large series of reaction, to the point that the energy that can be produced is not limited if the ENP is stable as long as it is present in the lattice. It is necessary to introduce a limited lifetime with a decay to reconcile the model with the experimental observations. The discussion of the simulation results in the light of experimental data leads me to propose a mean free path on the order of 100 Å, and a lifetime in the nanosecond range.",,,,,,

"An electrolytic cell operated with a hollow Pd cathode exploded in 2004. The violence of the explosion was surprising. We decided to re-analyze this event. The examination of the cell remnants indicate that the explosion occurred in the gas phase, and the electrodes seem unaffected. The stoichiometric H2–O2 mix can explode following different mechanisms that are briefly reviewed. A particular phenomenon called Shock Wave Amplification by Coherent Energy Release (SWACER) is able to produce strong detonations. A gas quantity similar to the original cell ignited by a hot spot or a spark produces only weak explosions that do not break the glass tube. Strong detonations are reproducibly obtained with a setup designed to induce the SWACER. The re-analysis of the event shows that the explosion was probably triggered by the SWACER resulting from a reaction in the hollow Pd cathode. In order to avoid accidents in the future during the operation of closed electrolytic cells, it is advised in addition to the conventional safety measures to avoid the presence of hollow, gas-filled metallic pieces in the reactor gas space, like a tube or a folded sheet.",,,,,,

"Palladium cathodes can be loaded with hydrogen or deuterium by electrolysis. Sometimes, when a piece of loaded palladium is removed from the cell, it turns red hot. A simplified numerical model confirms that high temperatures can be reached. The process requires a catalytic metal surface. The combination of a detonation in the gas phase and of palladium self-heating may offer an alternative scenario to explain the meltdown of the Fleischmann and Pons cell operated with a 1 cm cube palladium cathode.",,,,,,

"In the Mass Flow Calorimetry method, the heat released by an LENR reactor under test is measured by monitoring the temperature increase of a known flow of fluid passing over it. In the Air Flow Calorimetry method (AFC), the fluid is air. AFC appears to be a relatively simple method to measure the amount of heat produced by an LENR reactor. It is well suited when the LENR reactor surface temperature is high. It is easier to build than mass flow calorimeters using water-cooled or oil-cooled systems. Basically, the calorimeter is designed such that all the heat produced by the device under test is transferred to a known mass flow of cooling air. The accuracy of the method is governed by the control of the heat losses, the mass flow-rate of cooling air, the air heat capacity, the measure of the average air temperatures at inlet and outlet. Transpiration cooling is an efficient design to minimize the heat losses. The AFC method can be applied to reactors of any size and surface temperature. Its use is restricted to the testing of reactors that work continuously, because thermal equilibrium must be reached to make valid measurements. A thorough calibration procedure is essential to minimize the influence of errors on mass flows and temperature differences.",,,,,,

"World energy consumption is equivalent to 13865 million tons of oil (2018). Eighty one percent of energy is provided by fossil fuels. Energy generation releases 34 Gt of CO2 into the environment annually, which produces climate change. This paper considers the potential scenario with LENR sources of clean energy. It is based on the supposition that the new energy is generated by Metal Hydrogen Energy (MHE) stationary reactors that deliver heat at different temperature levels (100–200–350 deg C) as the technology evolves along the years. The potential penetration of LENR energy is analyzed taking into account the different conversion routes between the primary energy sources and the final industrial and domestic users. It is assumed that MHE replaces all conventional sources operated at a similar temperature level. . . .",,,,,,

The results of measurements of the DD-reaction yields from the Pd/PdO:Dx and the Ti/TiO2:Dx heterostructures in the energy range of 10–25 keV are presented. The neutron and proton fluxes are measured using a neutron detector based on 3Hecounters and a CR-39 plastic track detector. Comparisons with calculations show significant DD-reaction yield enhancement. It was first shown that the impact of the H+ and Ne+ ion beams in the energy range of 10–25 keV at currents of 0.01–0.1 mA on the deuterated heterostructure results in an appreciable DD-reaction yield stimulation. We also studied the neutron yield in DD reactions within a polycrystalline deuterium-saturated CVD diamond, during irradiation of its surface by a deuterium ion beam with energy of less than 30 keV. The measurements of the neutron flux in the beam direction are performed in dependence on the target angle, Beta, with respect to the beam axis. A significant anisotropy in neutron yield is observed, it was higher by a factor of 3 at Beta = 0 compared to that at Beta = +/- 45 deg.",,,,,,

"In our study of high temperature proton conductor (HTPC) it is shown that thermal and radiation effects can be correlated to a set of peculiarities of their structural and electric properties. These materials may be considered as model object to be searched for the elucidation of mechanism of anomalous phenomena in solid/deuterium systems. The ceramics are in specific cases superior to palladium. Our experiments were conducted with ceramic sandwich-like structure on the base of strontium cerate, espesially synthesized, with porous platinum or palladium coating. Analysis of some peculiarities of conductivity nature of HTPC shows that conductivity can not be satisfactorily explained without considering interaction between protons as well as protons and crystal lattice environment. The available electrochemical data on ionic (in this case on hydrogen nuclei) transport suggest that processes of nuclear interaction simultaneously occur which may result in cold fusion phenomena. The phase transition at 445°C and similar behavior at other points in the range to lOOO°C were found. We have established that pass through a region of phase transition is correlated to heat effect. A transition from exothermic to endothermic effect during cooling and heating of ceramic has been found. Analysis of X-ray studies shows that processes of explosive character inside lattice of sample, which give rise to the neutron and heat effects, can occur. We observed a incomprehensible influence of background on neutron emission, as well as a decay of neutron background inside the protection container with the sample.",,,,,,

"The loading characteristics of hydrogen gas in electrically self-heated nickel wires was investigated with a view to maximise hydrogen absorption and thereafter ""trigger"" it to generate anomalous excess heat as reported by Focardi et. al in early 1994. The nickel wires were found to absorb substantial quantity of hydrogen following several alternate cycles of absorption/desorption. But calorimetric studies conducted with the system so far indicate that we have not succeeded in triggering excess heat generation. However on dissolution and counting using standard liquid scintillation techniques, a number of hydrogen loaded nickel wires were found to contain tritium in the range of 3 Bq to 2333 Bq. This finding corroborates the detection of tritium in light water solutions electrolysed by nickel cathodes reported by the authors first at ICCF - 3 (Nagoya, 1992) and again at ICCF - 4 (Hawaii, 1993), confirming the occurrence of anomalous nuclear reactions in nickel-hydrogen systems.",,,,,,

"The generation of tritium during the electrolysis of aqueous light water alkali carbonate (K2CO3 and Li2CO3) solutions by nickel cathodes, first reported by us at the International Conference on Cold Fusion-3 (Nagoya, Japan, October 1992) has once again been verified and confirmed. During 1993, 10 out of 23 cells, whose electrolytes were analyzed using a newly set up dedicated liquid scintillation counting unit, indicated low tritium levels in the electrolyte, in the range of 0.5 to 4.8 Bq/ml. Except one cell, which contained 25% D2O, the remaining nine cells, which produced tritium, were charged with natural light water solutions only. Two of these cells, which were monitored for tritium every few days, and excluding cell OM-3, which was set up in 1992, indicated tritium level variations in a sawtooth fashion, suggesting the possible presence of an as yet unidentified mechanism responsible for periodically removing tritium from the electrolyte.",,,,,,

These rods were evaluated in terms of hydrogen loading ratio (H/Pd). The hydrogen loading ratios of Pd-Ag and Pd-Ce alloys were compared with that of a pure Pd rod. The hydrogen loading ratios of Pd rods were subjected to a kneeling and/or cold-working (swaging) are also compared with that of a cast Pd rod. The results show that the alloying markedly reduces the loading ratio, and neither a kneeling (350 - 650°C) your swaging (up to the processing ratio of 98%) produces a distinct effect.",,,,,,

"It is now a well established fact that in Cold Nuclear Fusion (CNF) only a small portion of heat results from nuclear reactions, the rest being of a mysterious origin. In this connection Prof. Peter Hagelstain writes in [ 1 ] : ""Some say that this heat can be explained easily by elementary chemical reactions, phase changes, or battery-like storage effects. I have trouble with these explanations"" . For instance, nickel electrolysis in light water produces the same amount of energy as that of palladium in heavy water. Besides, we have to consider a no less mysterious phenomenon of sonoluminescence, that was discovered in Russia in 1 933 by S.N.Rzhevkin. At first sight these phenomena seem to bear no correlation. But Julian Schwinger, the Nobel Laureate and profound research worker, has drawn parallels between cold fusion and sonoluminescence in his continuous technical publication on both topics. He notes in [2] : ""Like Cold Fusion, sonoluminescence ""should not exist"", but it does. This now well",,,,,,

"Tesla and Tandberg in their already old works have first discovered generation of very short and powerfol bursts of electric current with an absolutely unknown nature under some certain conditions of a gas discharge on direct current. One did not pay any serious attention to that phenomenon. And only in the recent works of Paulo and Alexandra Correa it was shown that by creation of the conditions for abnormal gas discharge (PAGD - Pulsed Abnormal Glow Discharge) on direct current powerful bursts of alternating current appear. The energy of these bursts exceeds several times the consumed energy (up to 10 times). In this experiment one can observe that a part of electric current carriers (obviously electrons) gain high velocities being the reason for excess energy generation. According to the unitary quantum theory it possible to explain easily the generation of excess energy [1, 7, 8]. The electrons can oscillate with a high plasma frequency relatively to very heavy positive ions. Their behaviour is possible to explain as oscillations in a potential well with the rims of various height. A t some certain values of initial phase the approximate equation of the unitary quantum theory with an oscillating charge can yield the ""mathernily home"" solution [1,7,8]. As a result of the electrones having gained a high energy with a high velosity they fly out of the wells, and always in one direction. It is the energy generation process - and not nuclear reactions - that are responsible for excess energy creation. The mathematical process model is created as well as an approximate solution of the non-linear difforential equation is achieved. The range of values of initial phases allowing the energy generation process is determined. If the experimental research of Tesla, Tandberg and Correa are correct then there is no doubt the foture power industry would be developing in this direction and not in today's fashionable direction of the cold nuclear fusion.",,,,,,

"The introduction of hydrogen into a metal during electrolysis of water involves primarily the metallic surface. The effect of surface morphology on electrochemical reaction kinetics is well described in the literature 1 therefore it seems to be reasonable to assume that the surface morphology of the cathodes could play a role in the electrochemical metal-hydride formation. Actually, a wide variety of surface features and profiles have been observed in the Pd cathodes typically employed in excess heat production experiments. These features are noted in both the as-prepared samples and the electrolyzed ones. In order to establish a correlation between the occurrence of a particular surface morphology and calorimetric results, it is necessary to identify a useful metric with which to describe and compare the different surface morphologies. In this work an approach based on Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) has been investigated. The method is oriented toward the identification of parameters suitable for a pre-screening of the materials.",,,,,,

In particular, one of the mechanisms involved is the enhancement and spatial localization of the electro-magnetic field at the metal/electrolyte interface, promoted by proper surface roughness and morphology. A further point to be considered is the dynamic character of the metal/electrolyte interface during electrochemical deuterium loading, that derives from the coupling between the different interface characteristics. Surface reconstruction of the metallic cathode is expected to happen, due to corrosion-deposition mechanisms, D/H transport, stress relaxation and defect production, and so on. All these mechanisms both affect and are affected by the surface properties, such as the morphology of the metal/electrolyte interface, the metallurgical and crystal structure of the cathode and the presence of contaminants.",,,,,,

The voltage of the discharge was less than 1000 V and the current was 5-150 mA. Samples before and after ions bombardment in the glow discharge were explored by the methods of mass spectrometry: the secondary ions (SIMS), the secondary ions with additional ionization of neutral sprayed particles (SNMS), spark (SMS), and thermo-ionization (TIMS), and also methods of energy dispersion X-ray spectral analysis (EDX). The alpha-, beta-, gamma- emission, and gamma- spectrometry for radioactive uranium specimens were also carried out before and after experiments in the glow discharge. Changes in structure, isotope, and element composition of the cathode samples depend on current density, integrated ions flow (fluence of ions), kind of irradiating ions and other experimental conditions. Attempts are made to estimate qualitatively and quantitatively the role of each of the parameters on intensity of the observed changes in cathode composition.

"The review of the main transmutation results in palladium and tungsten after the exposure to deuterium Glow Discharge (GD) measured by different Mass Spectrometry (MS) and Gamma-Spectrometry (GS) methods is given. The registered structure and isotopic ratio change alongside with formation of additional elements were accompanied by gamma and X-ray emission. The registered isotopic ratio change ranged within 2-1000 times, the quantity of additional elements undetected before varying within one tenth to dozens percents in Pd and Pd alloys. The isotopes with masses less than and exceeding those of the cathode material were measured in most of the experiments. The MS revealed that the tungsten isotopes transmutated into elements lighter than tungsten, higher post-experimental intensity of mass numbers 169, 170, 171, 178 and 180 being observed. The mass spectra peaks magnituded for isotopes lighter than W isotopes increased by factors ranging from 5 to 400. The registered increase varied from 5-50 cps in the original foils to 100-20 000 cps after the exposure to deuterium GD. Lighter isotopes in tungsten and tantalum foils placed on the GD cathode after deuterium GD exposure were identified using high resolution gamma/X-ray spectrometry. The comparison of thermal ionization mass-spectrometry (TIMS) data and data of gamma-spectra energy peaks allowed to assume that the peaks series observed in gamma spectra belong to the following isotopes: 169 70 Yb, 170 72 Hf , 171m 70 Yb, 172 72 Hf and 178 70 Yb. Correlation of TIMS and Gamma spectrometry data leads to the assumption that the appearance of light isotopes in tungsten resulted from the low-energy decay process initiation caused by deuterium GD.",,,,,,

"There are two different types of scientists who believe in the reality of the nuclear cold fusion. The researchers, who observed the excess energy by experiments, belong to the first type. On the other hand, a small number of theoreticians, who are working on the physics of the magnetic monopole, know that the nuclear reaction of the zero incident energy proceeds when the system involves a magnetic monopole. Since the former group still lacks a theory of the nuclear cold fusion based on the first principle of the natural law, I believe it is fruitful to explain to the former group how the theoretician of the particle physics comes to arrive at the conclusion that the nuclear cold fusion must occur if a magnetic monopole exists, in the framework of the quantum theory.",,,,,,

INTRODUCTION,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"The name of Cold Fusion (CF) comes from the interpretation given to certain phenomena taking place in a metal lattice roughly at room temperature, in terms of nuclear fusion, say between two deuterium nuclei: cold in comparison with the high temperatures of thermonuclear fusion (10^8 K). The first time this was suggested was in the Spring of 1989, ten years ago, by Fleischmann and Pons (1): their experiment gave rise to much turmoil all over the world, ending within a few months with the scientific community rejecting the experiment and thus this interpretation. Research in CF continued nevertheless in a few laboratories, mostly in the USA, Japan, Italy, Russia and China; International Conferences were held regularly, roughly every 1.5 years. However, after ten years, in spite of undeniable (although not overwhelming) progress in the field, there is hardly any communication between this small CF community and the scientific world at large.",,,,,,

"In two electrochemical transmutation experiments, unexpected oscillations in the recorded signals with a daily period were observed for deuterium/palladium loading ratio (D/Pd), temperature (T ) and pressure (P). The aim of the present study was to analyze the time courses of the signals of one of the experiments using an advanced signal-processing framework. The experiment was a high temperature (375 K), high pressure (750 kPa) and long-term (866 h . 35 days) electrochemical transmutation exploration done in 2008. The analysis was performed by (i) selecting the intervals of the D/Pd, T and P signals where the daily oscillations occurred, (ii) filtering the signals to remove low-frequency noise, (iii) analyzing the waveforms of the daily oscillations, (iv) applying Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) to decompose the signals into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs), (v) performing a statistical test on the obtained IMFs in order to identify the physically most meaningful oscillation mode, (vi) performing an power spectral analysis, (vii) calculating the correlations between the signals, and (viii) determining the time-dependent phase synchronization between the signals. We found that (i) in all three signals (D/Pd, T and P) a clear daily oscillation was present while the current density J did not show such an oscillation, (ii) the daily oscillation in T and P had similar waveforms and where anti-correlated to the oscillation in D/Pd, (iii) D/Pd and T had the highest correlation (r = 0.7693), (iv) all three signals exhibited phase synchronization over the whole signal length while the strongest phase synchronization took place between D/Pd and T . Possible origins of the daily oscillation were discussed and implications for further investigations and experiments were outlined.",,,,,,

Our analysis revealed that the data sets (i) exhibit a similar pattern and (ii) correlate with the predicted function. The last three peaks as a function of atomic mass A (intervals: 64–70, 116–129, 191–208 A) were significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with the averaged data despite great differences in the experiments.",,,,,,

"Nuclear transmutations are reported in many low-energy nuclear reaction (LENR) experiments. We showed in a previous study (Scholkmann and Nagel, J. Condensed Matter Nucl. Sci. 13 (2014) 485–494) that (i) the transmutation data of three independent experiments have a similar pattern and (ii) this pattern correlates with a model-based on the prediction of Widom and Larsen (WL). In the present study, we extended our analysis and investigated whether the abundance of elements in Earth’s crust is correlated with either (i) the WL-prediction, or (ii) the three LENR transmutation data sets. The first analysis revealed that there is no statistically significant correlation between these variables. The second analysis showed a significant correlation, but the correlation only reflects the trend of the data and not the peak-like pattern. This result strengthens the interpretation that the observed peak-like pattern in the transmutation data sets does not originate from contamination. Further implications of our study are discussed and a recommendation is given for future transmutation experiments.",,,,,,

"There is a small literature on the combination of low energy nuclear reactions (LENR) experiments and radiofrequencies (RF). The papers are worth attention in case they can teach anything about the mechanisms behind LENR. Application of RF to LENR electrochemical cells in the mid-1990s clearly showed increases in the production of excess power. More recently, RF have been measured in LENR cells. However, it is still possible that those data are artifacts of the operation of the system, and not indicative of LENR. It has been suggested that the appearance of RF in LENR experiments is the cause of LENR, and not merely a manifestation of such reactions. That possibility has significant implications. In the present paper, we summarize and analyze the results obtained by different research groups concerning the application and emission of RF in the kHz to GHz range associated with heat production during electrochemical loading of deuterium into palladium.",,,,,,

"The distinct nature of the cold fusion regime is emphasized: electromagnetic selection rules suppress radiation, permitting excess energy transference to the lattice; the coherent nature of the wave-function is at variance with the standard separation between barrier penetration and nuclear reactivity. The discussion is restricted to tritium production, based on the dd reaction that populates the first excited state of 4He, which decays into t+p, whereas the formation of 3He+n is energetically forbidden. Production rates compatible with the broad range of experimental results are realized within a narrow parametric interval. The great sensitivity to the physical circumstances is reminiscent of the reproducibility problems that have plagued this field.",,,,,,

That cold fusion refers to a different regime is emphasized. The new regime is characterized by intermittency in the production of excess heat, tritium and neutrons. A scenario is sketched, based upon the hypothesis that small segments of the lattice can absorb released nuclear energy.",,,,,,

From the very beginning in a radio broadcast on the evening of March 23, 1989, I have asked myself—not whether Pons and Fleischmann are right—but whether a mechanism can be identified that will produce nuclear energy by manipulations at the atomic-the chemical-level. Of course, the acceptance of that interpretation of their data is needed as a working hypothesis, in order to have quantitative tests of proposed mechanisms.",,,,,,

"The electrolysis of heavy water is being investigated with an insulated flow calorimetric system. In each of a series of tests, the electrolyte was 0.1 to 1.0 LiOD in D2O and cylindrical palladium cathodes surrounded by wire-wound platinum anodes were used at cathode current densities of 100 to 800 mA/cm^2. The most recent test was made with a ""closed system"" without off-gas in which the electrolysis gases were internally recombined. Fast neutrons and gamma rays were measured continuously during each test. It was shown that certain system perturbations could initiate and extend the generation of excess power. In one test, an apparent increase in the neutron count rate was also coincident with system perturbations.",,,,,,

"Recently, a considerable number of experimental investigations have been carried out in different laboratories to determine, whether a possible catalysis of deuterium-deuterium fusion processes in condensed matter takes place or not. In some papers evidence was found for a week neutron production, similar as it was announced by Jones et al. for the electrolysis of heavy water using Titanium cathodes. Somewhat later the observation of neutron admission during the absorption of Deuterium gas in Titanium and other metals was announced, too.",,,,,,

It is concluded that T-concentration variations in the electrolyte above the level due to natural enrichment can be detected with confidence and therefore that open-cell experiments are convenient to investigate T -production.

"Before 1996, when I gave lectures on responsible conduct of research or research ethics, I used to emphasize the importance of ensuring in biomedical research the quality and integrity of research data. My reason for emphasizing this point was that, as opposed to situations associated with maintaining comparable standards in clinical trials, in which existing funding levels allow for the possibility that particular experiments will be repeated, in biomedical research, one cannot obtain funding to repeat research experiments that are large and expensive. For this reason, it was (and has remained) imperative that instances of possible fraud, misconduct and sloppy work be reduced from the outset. Because of limited funding, as a consequence, the self-correcting process of science may not be operative in these areas. I then used to end this part of my discussion by citing how in cold fusion research, and because of the potential significance and impact of the particular claims associated with this area, the self-correcting nature of science worked. The cold fusion experiments have been repeated dozens of times without success. The conclusion was that they were proven to be wrong. However, I was basing my conclusion on the numerous reports in newspapers and scientific magazines but not on any readings of the original literature.",,,,,,

As a result, we categorized the temperature changes into three different types that were independent of coating materials. In almost all experiments, the resistance decreased and the D2 pressure initially increased briefly and then gradually decreased in the D2 release process.

"To investigate the possibility of deuterium-deuterium nuclear fusion in a palladium metal, we carried out two kinds of experiments: low-energy deuterium ion bombardments with deuterated palladium, and deuterium transport through palladium. In the bombardment experiments, the cross sections for d(d,p)t reactions were measured to be less than 1.5 x 10-11 b at an ion energy of 2 keV. Measured branching ratios between d(d,p)t and d(d,niHe were unity in the ion energy range between 2 and 40 keY, even though the deuterium-deuterium nuclear fusion occurred in palladium. We also estimated the minimum detectable values for the charged-particle detection system, NE213 nuclear detector system, 3He counter, and a quadrupole mass-spectroscope system used in both the experiments. In the deuterium transport experiments, we tried to detect nuclear fusion products by using these detector systems placed in a vacuum chamber which extracted deuterium from the sample palladium. Any extraordinary nuclear products, however, could not be observed in the experiments carried out under various temperature variations and for various modifications of palladium surfaces.",,,,,,

"Cold fusion experiments were initiated with solid targets made from titanium loaded with deuterium gas on receipt of reports of the successful Frascati experiments1. The absorption of deuterium by Ti is a reversible process and when titanium is heated in a deuterium atmosphere, the reaction will continue until the concentration of deuterium in the metal attains an equilibrium value. This equilibrium value depends on the specimen temperature and the pressure of the surrounding deuterium atmosphere. Any imposed temperature or pressure change causes rejection or absorption of deuterium until a new equilibrium state is achieved. If the surface of titanium is clean, the rate of absorption increases rapidly with temperature. At temperatures above 500°C, the equilibrium is achieved in a matter of a few seconds. However deuterium absorption is considerably reduced if the surface of Ti is contaminated with oxygen. Keeping in view these facts, a procedure was evolved for titanium target preparation and subsequent deuteration. The following sections describe the details of preparation of the targets, their chemical cleaning and degassing followed by deuteration process.",,,,,,

"Experiments have been carried out to study the variation and reproducibility of electrical resistance as a functiol1 of the deuterium concentration (D/Ti) in titanium wires. Deuterium loading is carried out in a series of steps by passing a D.C. current to ohmically heat the sample for some time in D2 gas until a measurable quantity is absorbed. After every loading, the wire resistance and decrease in the gas pressure are measured at room temperature using a four probe resistance meter (±0.2% accuracy) and an oil manometer respectively.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"Significantly, it is observed that an apparently simple property like electrical resistance is not easily reproducible. The pre loading heat treatment and residual gases in high vacuum appear to play an important role on the behaviour of the resistance in TiDx. The preliminary results also suggest that this property may not be useful in estimating the deuterium content in titanium.",,,,,,

"A series of experiments were carried out to detect production of neutrons from a commercial (Milton Roy) palladium—nickel electrolytic cell operated with 0.1 M LiOH or LiOD as the electrolyte at a current density of ~ 80 mA/cm^2. Neutron emission was monitored using a bank of 16 BF3 detectors embedded in a cylindrical moderator assembly. A dead—time filtering technique was employed to detect the presence of neutron ""bursts"" if any and characterize the multiplicity distribution of such neutron bursts. It was found that with an operating Pd—D2O cell located in the centre of the neutron detection set—up, the daily average neutron count rate increased by about 9% throughout a one month period, over the background value of ~ 2386 counts/day indicating an average daily neutron production of ~ 2220 neutrons/day by the cell. In addition analysis of the dead—time filtered counts data indicated that about 6.5% of these neutrons were emitted in the form of bursts of 20 to 100 neutrons each. On an average there were an additional 6 burst events per day during electrolysis with LiOD over the daily average background burst rate of 1.7 bursts/day. The frequency of occurrence of burst events as well as their multiplicity was significantly higher with D20 + LiOD in the cell when compared with background runs as also light water ""control"" runs.",,,,,,

"Several pairs of cold rolled palladium cathodes (40 microm thick) were electrolyzed in series for various times up to six minutes. One of each pair was in light water electrolyte and the other in heavy water electrolyte. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies performed six months after electrolysis of the heavy water cathodes revealed asperities, craters, and nodules, suggesting that localized melting and recrystallization had occurred, as we reported previously on specimens electrolyzed for longer times. AFM studies 1 .5 years later revealed loose, nanometer-sized particles, indicating that the heavy water cathodes continued to change during storage, long after electrolysis was performed, which we also reported previously on other cathodes. The morphology of palladium cathodes electrolyzed in light water electrolyte remained nearly identical to that of the unelectrolyzed control, even two years after electrolysis.",,,,,,

"A direct current arc was run between ultrapure graphite electrodes dipped in ultrapure water for 1 to 20 h, The graphite residue collected at the bottom of the water trough was analyzed for iron content by a conventional spectrographic method, It was found, in the first few experiments, that the iron content in the graphite residue was fairly high, depending on the duration of the arcing, The experiment was repeated initially six times, and the results showed large variations in iron content (50 to 2000 parts per million (ppm)) in the carbon residue, In the second series of experiments, which were done with the water trough fully covered, the amount of iron in the carbon residue decreased significantly (20 to 100 ppm), Here also there were large variations in the iron concentration in the residue, although the experiments were performed under identical conditions, Whether iron is really being synthesized through transmutation from carbon and oxygen as suggested by George Oshawa or is getting concentrated to different degrees through some other phenomenon is not currently clear, The iron in the carbon residue was also analyzed mass spectrometrically for the abundance of its various isotopes, and the results were more or less the same as that of natural iron, Besides iron, the presence of other elements like silicon, nickel, aluminum, and chromium was also determined in the carbon residue, and it was found that the variation of their concentrations followed the same pattern as that of iron.",,,,,,

"Our study shows that the cross-section for fusion improves considerably if d-d pairs are located in linear (one-dimensional) chainlets or line defects. Such non-equilibrium defects can exist only in a solid matrix. Further, solids harbor lattice vibrational modes (quanta, phonons) whose longitudinal-optical modes interact strongly with electrons and ions. One such interaction, resulting in potential inversion, causes localization of electron pairs on deuterons. Thus, we have attraction of D+ - D- pairs and strong screening of the nuclear repulsion due to these local electron pairs (local charged bosons: acronym, lochons). This attraction and strong coupling permits low-energy deuterons to approach close enough to alter the standard equations used to define nuclear-interaction cross-sections. These altered equations not only predict that low-energy-nuclear reactions (LENR) of D+ - D- (and H+ - H-) pairs are possible, they predict that they are probable.",,,,,,

"In heavily hydrogenated (deuterated) palladium crystals, the crystallinity is degraded. This non-uniformity results in phonon modes that are localized and of higher frequency than for unloaded lattices. These modes create dynamic electrostatic fields that couple strongly with both bound and free electrons and the hydrogen (H and D) sub-lattice. A consequent potential inversion leads to the formation of ""lochons"" (local-charged bosons-electron pairs in the singlet state) and results in H- or D- ions in the sub-lattice. The nuclear-Coulomb repulsion between colliding D+ D- ion pairs in the sub-lattice is considerably reduced by the resultant ""strong screening"" and ""lochon-drag"" effects. Furthermore, work is done, by the bound lochon in a D- ion attracting an adjacent D+ ion. This results in reductions: of the deuteron’s electron-orbital radii, as the ion pair approaches; of the mass deficit between the deuteron pair and a 4He atom (or a proton pair and a 2He/2H atom); and finally of the Coulomb repulsion between nuclear protons in a helium nucleus. Thus, the end product of such a deuteron-pair fusion is an excited-helium nucleus (4He*) with lower energy relative to that resulting from energetic deuteron collisions. This reduced energy of the excited nucleus may be lower than its new fragmentation levels. The effect of lochon mediation, to alter the nuclear potential-well and fragmentation energies, allows decay to the 4He ground states to be free of particulate radiation. This decay process, of ""neutral"" 2He (from p+p) or 4He excited nuclei, is also a basis for observed transmutation.",,,,,,

"In heavily (deuterated or hydrogenated) palladium, some of the crystallinity is lost. As a consequence, the localized phonon modes of the crystal/damaged-region interface have a much higher frequency than the host. These high-frequency modes create electrostatic fields that interact strongly with electrons of the local atoms. A resulting instantaneous potential inversion, from polarization, leads to the formation of lochons (local charged bosons-electron pairs in the singlet state, perhaps isolated from the Pd d-orbital energy levels) and of an associated H+ or D+ ion (with its two shared electrons instantaneously isolated into the adjacent Pd d-levels). The Coulomb repulsion between the nuclei of these pairs is greatly reduced by strong screening from the lochons that can even generate an attractive polarization potential. Furthermore, the mutual tunneling penetration probability of the Coulomb barrier is enhanced by correlated fluctuations. This arises from the generalized uncertainty relations, x px,E t = (n + 1/2)h/(1 - ?2)0.5, where n may be on the order of 10-100 and where results from two models are combined. The integer n values represent excitations in the phonon modes of the H or D sub-lattice and ? is the correlation coefficient with 0 < ? < 1. Higher values of nand ?, for a particle in a potential well, imply less localization and greater uncertainties in location (i.e., extending its probability distribution further into the barrier). These periodic fluctuations into the barrier are an interference effect similar to that of beat frequencies.",,,,,,

"Cold Fusion is the name initially applied to what are now called, more generally, Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR). Such reactions produce nuclear products and generate thermal energy. Calorimeters are the instruments used to measure the energy production. They can be based on either mass or heat flow. Some heat flow calorimeters use the Seebeck effect in particular materials, where temperature differences produced by LENR generate measurable voltages from thermoelectric devices. This paper is a review of Seebeck calorimeters that have been used in LENR experiments. Compilations of their characteristics and performance are provided. The scaling of the performance of Seebeck calorimeters with their size is considered. The equations that govern the behavior of both mass flow and heat flow calorimeters are given.",,,,,,

We have designed a low level neutron detector for cold fusion expcrimenu with tilanium and deuterium gas. The basic principle of the system is to monitor as many relevant parameters as possible and store them event-by-event and analyze the data afterwards. The result of the experiment was that no significant excess of neutrons was observed. We also discussed the cosmic radiation that may influence low level measurements of neutrons.,,,,,,

Summary,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"Co-deposition electrochemical cells are a simple means to examine novel nuclear reactions. In this study, palladium and deuterium atoms were co-deposited on a cathode at stoichiometric densities. Bubble detector neutron dosimeters were used to measure equivalent dose levels during electrolytic deposition. Standard configuration cells expected to produce excess neutrons were denoted as experimental cells and contained an electrolyte consisting of palladium(II) chloride, lithium chloride, and heavy water (D2O). The control cells used copper(II) chloride, lithium chloride, and D2O electrolyte. Experimental and control cells were supplied current, increasing from 0.1 to 100.0 mA over a period of 20 days. For test days 9 through 20, the standard configuration experimental cells exhibited significantly higher average neutron radiation than the controls at a 99% confidence level. Alternative configurations involving increasing current over a shortened time scale, substitutions of water in place of D2O or potassium chloride for lithium chloride, as well as inclusion of depleted uranium near the cell cathodes all resulted in inconclusive evidence for promoting neutron production.",,,,,,

Abstract,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"Some 200 years ago Edmund Becquerel discovered a new phenomenon, the photo-­voltaic effect, a discovery ­­that led eventually to the modern solar panel. A development curve that took 150 years. Towards the end of the 19th century Heinrich Hertz and some contemporaries discovered and studied the photo-electric effect, the liberation of electrons from metal surfaces when exposed to light, and Peltier published his work on thermo-electricity. Frank Gordon and Harper Whitehouse may have added another new chapter to this story when they discovered and developed a device they call the Lattice Energy Converter (LEC) Many iterations of the LEC device have demonstrated the spontaneous production of voltage and current for sustained periods. The device offers unusual simplicity and remarkable replicability.",,,,,,

The paper discusses two techniques for studying the multiplicity spectrum of neutron emission in cold fusion experiments. In the first method the multiplicity distribution of counts in 20 ms time intervals is analysed to give information about the statistics of neutron emission in cold fusion. The results of six such experiments indicate that about 10 to 25% of the neutrons produced in cold fusion are emitted in the form of bunches 400 to 600 neutrons each. The other method discussed is an adaptation of the Artificial Dead Time method developed originally for reactor noise analysis as well as for the passive neutron assay of plutonium. An expression for the fractional loss of counts in the presence of dead time is derived. It is shown that a neutron detection efficiency of ~ 1% is adequate to estimate the average multiplicity as well as the fraction of bunched neutron emission in the presence of a Poisson background.,,,,,,

"The observation of significant neutron yield from gas loaded titanium samples at Frascati in April 1989 opened up an alternate pathway to the investigation of anomalous nuclear phenomena in deuterium/solid systems, complimenting the electrolytic approach. Since then atleast six different groups have successfully measured burst neutron emission from deuterated titanium shavings following the Frascati methodology, the special feature of which was the use of liquid nitrogen to create repeated thermal cycles resulting in the production of non-equilibrium conditions in the deuterated samples. At Trombay several variations of the gas loading procedure have been investigated including induction heating of single machined titanium targets in a glass chamber as well as use of a plasma focus device for deuteriding its central titanium electrode.",,,,,,

"It is now two years since the first reports of the occurrence of nuclear reactions at ambient temperatures in deuterated metals such as Pd or Ti were published. ‘Cold fusion', as this phenomenon has now come to be known, has, however, become embroiled in intense controversy with the scientific community becoming sharply polarized into ‘believers' and ‘non-believers' of this novel phenomenon. This ambivalence is primarily because of the non-reproducibility of the claimed results by many reputed research groups that have often used sophisticated experimental equipment. However, as the present review clearly shows, a large number of laboratories in many different countries have now obtained very reliable experimental evidence confirming the generation of 2.45-MeV neutrons, tritium, charged particles, X-rays, etc., both in electrolysis experiments and in a variety of other D2 -/plasma-/ion-beam-loading experiments, thereby confirming the nuclear origin of the phenomenon. . . .",,,,,,

"A number of open cell electrolysis experiments of the Mills and Kneizys type using Nickel as cathode, Pt wire as anode and aqueous solutions of carbonates of Potassium, Sodium and Lithium (natural and enriched) as electrolyte have been carried out in three different laboratories at Trombay. The cells were fabricated out of commercial dewar vacuum flasks. The difference in temperature at equilibrium between the operating cells and that of an identical dummy reference flask was measured to deduce excess heat. The cells were calibrated using resistance heaters. In all, studies have been carried out so far in 29 electrolytic cells with various electrolytes. In some cases a mixture of H20 and D20 was used. The cells were operated for a few weeks at a time and excess heat up to a maximum of 70% appears to be present in most cells when the input joule power is upto a watt or two. The current density was less than 40 mA/cm^2.",,,,,,

"Electrolyte samples before and after electrolysis were analysed for tritium content after microdistillation to eliminate chemiluminiscence effects. Samples from 18 out of 29 experiments analysed have indicated tritium levels varying in the region of 46 Bq/ml to 3390 Bq/ml. One cell with enriched Li2C03 solution in H20 which was monitored continuously for over a month indicated that tritium generation is continuous. Although the highest amount of tritium produced so far was with a K2C03 in 25% D20 cell, the generation of tritium in cells containing only H20 is a new finding.",,,,,,

"In 1990 the BARC group presented results at several fora, based on our neutron multiplicity studies as well as tritium measurements, that suggested micro-nuclear explosions seem to occur at localized hot spots in which both Tritium and neutrons are generated, subject to the n/T branching ratio anomaly. It was estimated that about 108 to 1010 tritium generating lenr reactions take place in these hot spots accompanied by a very small fraction of neutrons. During the last few years several researchers have reported detecting a variety of transmutation reaction products in localized sites, often associated with some type of crater formation. Other experimenters have reported online detection of flashes of ""thermal hot spots"" in their cathodes. It is therefore tempting to speculate that perhaps the concept of micro-nuclear explosions can be extended to heat generating helium producing reactions too, as well as nuclear reactions responsible for transmutation products. Many theoretical models such as those that depend on the catalyzing role of some exotic intermediate agent (such as Bose-Einstein condensates, deuteron clusters, Erzions, poly neutrons, trapped neutrons etc) seem to point to the possibility of occurrence of chain events. Two decades into the CMNS era, it is therefore worthwhile reexamining the merits of the micro-nuclear explosion hypothesis and seek independent experimental evidence to either corroborate or refute such a hypothesis.",,,,,,

"Within a few months of the Fleischmann Pons announcement of 1989 several independent groups at BARC had confirmed the production of neutrons and tritium in a variety of electrolytic cells. Among the many findings of the BARC groups were the first hint of the neutron to tritium branching ratio anomaly, namely that tritium production is several orders of magnitude higher than that of neutrons, that neutrons and tritium are probably being emitted simultaneously and that at least in the case of titanium targets, the generated tritium is found to be entrenched in highly localized ""hot spots"". But the most intriguing observation of all was that neutrons appeared to be emitted in sharp bursts of up to 10^3 neutrons per event. An integrated view of all these findings taken together led to the speculation that perhaps up to 10^10-10^12 tritons each were being generated in the form of micro-nuclear explosions, with neutron emission being only a minor side reaction in the process. Whatever the nature of the phenomenon, it seemed to be occurring in a highly localized fashion, both in space and time. Since those early days however the aspect of spatially localized occurrence of nuclear reactions has gained further acceptance through the concept of ""Nuclear Active Environment"". The observation of thermal hot spots, micro-craters and isolated regions wherein transmutation products are concentrated on the cathode surface has reinforced the suspicion that the phenomenon is spatially localized. But how reliable is the evidence for localization in time? This review revisits our early neutron multiplicity measurements since it appears that confirmation of multiple neutron production is possibly the only handle we have to establish the temporal localization feature and thereby give some insight into the possible occurrence of micro-nuclear explosions which in turn would have a tremendous bearing on the nature of the theoretical mechanism governing these LENR reactions.",,,,,,

"Within days of the F&P announcement of 1989, several groups at BARCembarked on a program to look for the generation of neutrons and tritium when deuterium (or hydrogen) is loaded into metals such as Pd, Ti and Ni. Electrolytic, gas and plasma loading techniques were deployed. Post run electrolyte samples were analyzed for tritium content using standard liquid scintillation techniques. In the case of gas and plasma loaded ""dry"" samples, surface tritium content was measured directly using windowless beta counters. Autoradiography was deployed as a very effective tool to monitor the spatial distribution of tritium in the near surface layers of test samples. The first confirmation of copious tritium generation was obtained on 21 April 1989 in a commercial ""Milton Roy"" Pd–D2O electrolytic cell. The results obtained during the first year of the BARC Cold Fusion campaign were presented at ICCF 1 in March 1990 where we reported observing tritium generation in 22 different electrolytic cells, which were set up totally independently by diverse research groups. The present paper revisits the early BARCtritium results obtained in a variety of experimental configurations during the period 1989–1996.",,,,,,

"In a series of papers, cited in the main body of the paper below, detailed calculations have been presented which show that electromagnetic and weak interactions can induce low energy nuclear reactions to occur with observable rates for a variety of processes. A common element in all these applications is that the electromagnetic energy stored in many relatively slow-moving electrons can, under appropriate circumstances, be collectively transferred into fewer, much faster electrons with energies sufficient for the latter to combine with protons (or deuterons, if present) to produce neutrons through weak interactions. The produced neutrons can then initiate low energy nuclear reactions through further nuclear transmutations. The aim of this paper is to extend and enlarge on various examples analyzed previously, present simplified order-of-magnitude estimates for each and illuminate a common unifying theme among them.

"Results of a calorimetric study established the energy produced, over and above input energy, from electrolytic loading of deuterium into Pd was 150 MJ/cc of Pd (14000 eV/Pd atom) for a 46 day period. High fugacity of deuterium was developed in unalloyed palladium via electrolysis (0.5 molar electrolyte of lithium deuteroxide, LiOD) with the use of an independent electromigration current. In situ resistivity measurements of Pd were used to assay activity of D in the Pd lattice (ratio of D/Pd) and employed as an indicator of phase changes. During this period, two run-away events were triggered by suddenly increasing current density resulting in 100 percent excess power (2.4 watts output with 1.2 watts input) and necessitating temporary cut back in electrolysis current. The average excess power (excluding run-away) ranged from 4.7 ± 0.15 to 9.6 ± 0.30 percent of input power while input power ranged from 2.000 to 3.450 watts, confirming the Fleischmann-Pons effect. The precision was: Power In = +/- .0005 W; Delta T = +/- .05°C; Power Out = +/- .015 W for an overall precision of +/- 0.5%. High fugacity was required for these results, and the triggered run-away events required even higher fugacity. Using thermodynamic energy balance, it was found that the energy release was of such magnitude that the source of the energy is from a nuclear source, however the exact reaction was not determined in this work. . . .",,,,,,

SolidWorks is used to simulate the motion of atoms and ions in the lattice. These two approaches give identical results for the vibrations of the deuterons indicating that large vibrations of deuterons are possible when the microstructure is a mixture of beta deuteride and small volume percent delta SAV phase. These conditions result from the unique geometry and crystallography of d phase. According to both the model and simulation, as the size of delta phase increases, opportunity for high amplitude vibrations of deuterons increases. Increasing temperature should have a similar effect.",,,,,,

"The addition of three superabundant vacancy (SAV) phases, gamma (Pd7VacD6–8), delta (Pd3VacD4 – octahedral), and delta' (Pd3VacD4 – tetrahedral) to the palladium – isotopic hydrogen phase diagram was recently reported [1]. Also, in that study, production of excess heat from a nuclear source during electrolysis in heavy water indicated portions of the palladium (Pd) – deuterium (D) specimen were in the ordered delta phase, while a drop in resistance of the Pd during excess heat, with an increase in temperature, indicated portions of the specimen had shifted to the ordered delta' phase. Both delta and delta', create intersecting channels along the edges of the unit cells which are in effect long strings of Pd lattice vacancies for fast electron transport or a deuteron resonance condition. At high D/Pd ratio, the Pd-D alloy can be multiphase. An estimate of the volume fraction (fv) of d phase is made from the amount of nuclear energy measured. . . .",,,,,,

"To understand if cold fusion produces nuclear energy, a calorimeter was designed for electrolysis of Pd in heavy water with a precision of ± 0.5%: it exhibited excess power levels of between 20 and 240 W/cm3 accompanied by excess heat of 150 MJ/cm3 or 14 000 eV/atom of Pd, corroborating the original findings and verifying a nuclear source. An extra (other than commonly used Pt/H2O) control experiment using Pd/D2O lacked essential conditions necessary for producing the Fleischmann-Pons heat effect and so did not yield the Fleischmann-Pons heat effect, and neither did all Pt/H2O controls. Ten hard-to-achieve but vital conditions are disclosed for a recognizable (measurable) Fleischmann-Pons heat effect; and these resulted in 100% reproducibility in this study. The phenomenon should not be rejected as a valid topic of research: it is not Rutherford's moonshine and rejection was categorically premature.",,,,,,

"A calorimeter, designed for electrolysis of Pd in heavy water, capable of measuring heat and power output with a precision of ± 0.5%, was used to determine changes in output during a compulsory quick-drop in temperature. The change in temperature was forced on the electrolysis cell while it was producing nuclear energy at excess power levels of 240 W/cm3 and after producing a continuous excess heat amount of 150 MJ/cm3 (14 000 eV/atom of Pd). The temperature change (from 82.5 °C to ~0 °C) resulted in a total loss of excess power (nuclear power) and indicates the regions of the microstructure that were ordered superabundant vacancy (SAV) phase transformed from d to the ordered superabundant vacancy phase d'. The d phase is responsible for producing excess heat and power while the d' phase produces no excess heat or power. Deuterium in the d phase occupies the octahedral sites but occupies the tetrahedral sites in the d' phase. In either case, d and d' are minor phases with volume fractions in the two-phase microstructure of approximately 0.03 and 5.0 percent for d and d', respectively. This evidence of termination of excess power supports previous indications in the literature of such a transformation.",,,,,,

Two samples of Pd were obtained from Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo K. K. (Japan). One sample gave 20% excess heat before the run was prematurely terminated and the other sample gave no excess heat.

"The calorimeter is dosed in an energy sense, pressured with D2, and stirred. Calibration was done before, during and after heat measurement. Four different calibration procedures were used including a blank using a platinum cathode. Temperature gradients were monitored and found to change when excess heat was produced. This change strongly suggests that normal electrolysis releases energy mainly at the anode while excess heat is released mainly at the cathode. The bulk D/Pd ratio was measured during initial charging and was found to reach 0.82. Voltage difference between cathode and reference electrode was measured and indicates that the deuterium concentration gradient is small during initial charging at 0.02A/cm^2.",,,,,,

Excess volume in each palladium cathode was measured after each study. Heat production is proposed to be prevented if excess volume is too large.,,,,,,

"Two pieces of palladium sheet similar to that used by Takahashi were loaded with deuterium in a Pons-Fleischmann-type electrolytic cell, and heat production was measured. One sheet produced a steady increase in excess power that reached 7.5 W (20% of input power) before the study was interrupted. A second similar sheet from a different batch of palladium did not produce any measurable excess power. There were differences in the loading behavior, the maximum stoichiometry, and the presence of excess volume in the deuteride made from these materials. The first sheet contained 0.8% excess volume after having been deloaded from its maximum deuterium/palladium (D/Pd) ratio of 0.82 to 0.73, and the second sheet contained 13.5% excess volume while at its maximum ratio of 0.75. The high excess volume in the latter case is an indication of internal escape paths that reduce the required high D/Pd ratio.",,,,,,

"Evidence is presented to show that the energy-active state is located within the surface of electrolyzed palladium. Although a high average D/Pd ratio is required to form this state, this is not the only condition. Several additional conditions must exist to cause a very high surface composition to form and to cause a conversion of the resulting material from beta-PdD to another phase. The required high surface composition depends only in part on a high average composition. Absence of microcracks in the surface region, presence of surface and near surface impurities, and external energy application influence the eventual nucleation and growth of the required phase.",,,,,,

The ability to reproduce any phenomenon depends on knowing the major variables and conditions required for the events to operate. In the case of cold fusion, even fundamental factors such as the D/Pd ratio and the crystal structure of the nuclear-active regions are not known. It is the intent of this paper to demonstrate several techniques for obtaining such information and the results obtained from their application to the Pons-Fleischmann Effect.",,,,,,

"ABSTRACT The limiting composition of beta-PdD obtained during electrolytic loading results from a complex competition between diffusion of D atoms through any surface barrier, diffusion within the bulk sample, and loss of deuterium gas from surface-penetrating cracks. Reductions in surface crack concentration and surface-barriers are essential steps to achieve high compositions. The highest compositions within any sample are located within the surface region as a complex patch-work of values. The open circuit voltage (OCV), referenced to platinum, is useful in understanding changes in the surface composition and structure. Values as high as -1.35 V have been observed for highly loaded beta-PdD. Evidence for several new, possibly impurity stabilized structures is given.",,,,,,

"ABSTRACT Energy from present sources has proven to have serious limitations. Fortunately for the future of mankind, several new but controversial sources of energy have been discovered. This talk will describe a method to initiate nuclear reactions within solid materials, so-called Chemically Assisted Nuclear Reactions (CANR) when the environment is the focus or Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR) if the process is to be emphasized. Proposed is a new field of study which combines the electron environment (chemistry) with the nuclear environment (nuclear physics), two environments which are thought not to interact. The method generates energy without producing serious amounts of radiation or radioactive waste. In addition, the method is suggested as a means to reduce the radioactivity associated with previously generated nuclear waste. A wide range of experience obtained world-wide over the last ten years will be described and the controversial nature of the method will be discussed.",,,,,,

Over 9 years have passed since many of us were lured into believing that the Pons-Fleischmann effect would solve the world’s energy problems and make us all rich. Things have not yet worked out as we had hoped. Each of us have followed a different path through the labyrinth of this expectation. I would like to share with you my particular path and show you how I came to believe that problems of reproducibility are caused solely by the properties of the materials in which the nuclear reactions are proposed to occur.,,,,,,

The phenomenon is conventionally known as ""cold fusion,"" or chemically assisted nuclear reactions (CANR)"" when the environment is emphasized, or ""low-energy nuclear-reactions (LENR)"" if emphasis is placed on the process. A wide range of observations involving anomalous production of energy as well as nuclear products have been published. While many of the claims are still open to interpretation, the general conclusion is that an important, novel phenomenon has been discovered which deserves renewed interest.",,,,,,

"Many people still believe that cold fusion is the result of bad science. In contrast, numerous laboratories in at least 10 countries have now claimed production of anomalous energy using a variety of methods, many of which are now reproducible. This energy is proposed to result from nuclear reactions initiated within a special periodic array of atoms at modest temperatures (energy). Evidence for nuclear reactions involving fusion of deuterium, transmutation involving both light and heavy hydrogen, and nuclear interaction between heavy nuclei has been published. The claims, if true, reveal a new method to release nuclear energy without harmful radiation and without the radioactivity associated with conventional methods. This paper examines published evidence describing this new phenomenon in order to test its reality and to extend an understanding of the process.",,,,,,

Detailed information supporting the claims can be obtained from the website (http://home.netcom.com/~storms2/index.html) as well as from any scientific data base. These claims provide the incentive for this study. In this work, methods to produce anomalous energy are studied using electrolytic loading in D2O of various materials (the Pons-Fleischmann method). Past work has concentrated on using palladium as the active material. This paper will demonstrate that energy-producing reactions can be made to occur in materials other than palladium. A unique method is proposed to explore many of the variables associated with the phenomenon.",,,,,,

"The US government has once again made an effort to evaluate the reality of the phenomenon call cold fusion. The first effort was made in 1989 by the ERAB Panel (Energy Research Advisory Board) shortly after Profs. Fleischmann and Pons announced their discovery. The result was a mixed message in which no support for the claims was provided. Nevertheless, an implication was made to evaluate proposals by the normal peer review process. None were funded by the DOE (Department of Energy). Now a new evaluation has been undertaken by a panel of reviewers assembled by the DOE, mainly from the physics profession.",,,,,,

This claim was rejected because insufficient supporting experimental information was provided, the claim was very difficult to replicate, and no plausible explanation could be proposed. During the 20 years since then, studies in at least 8 countries has provided a rich collection of information, improved reproducibility, and encouraged many explanations. This work has been reviewed by Storms[6] in 2007 based on over 1000 citations and will not be repeated here.

"Presence and absence of expected radiation, occurrence of nuclear reactions having only one apparent product, and transmutation reactions involving addition of more than one deuteron all indicate involvement of large clusters of deuterons in the LENR process. These clusters are proposed to hide their Coulomb barrier and to react with isolated deuterons to produce fusion and to react with larger nuclei to produce transmutation. Members of the cluster not directly involved in the nuclear reaction might be scattered by the released energy, thereby allowing momentum to be conserved and the resulting energy to produce particles having energy too small to be easily detected or to cause easily detectable secondary reactions. Justification of this model is discussed. This proposed model is consistent with most observations, but raises additional questions about the nature of such super-clusters and other ways the energy may be communicated directly to the lattice that will be addressed in future papers.",,,,,,

"The Fleischmann-Pons Effect (FPE, aka cold fusion) was rejected as legitimate science within a year after its announcement in 1989. The growing need for a source of clean energy makes a re-examination of the initial rejection increasingly important. An effective way of assessing the status of the effect as legitimate science is to apply criteria that have been established by scientific skeptics. When 27 criteria set forth by Langmuir, Sagan and Shermer are applied, the requirements for scientific legitimacy appear to be met. In addition, a large and growing number of independent experiments are consistent with a nuclear mechanism being the cause of FPE.",,,,,,

The discovery was met with considerable skepticism, but supporting evidence has accumulated, plausible theories have been suggested, and research is continuing in at least eight countries. This paper provides a brief overview of the major discoveries and some of the attempts at an explanation. The evidence supports the claim that a nuclear reaction between deuterons to produce helium can occur in special materials without application of high energy. This reaction is found to produce clean energy at potentially useful levels without the harmful byproducts normally associated with a nuclear process.

"Cold fusion or Low Energy Nuclear Reaction (LENR) is a process that results in various nuclear reactions involving all isotopes of hydrogen within what appear to be ordinary materials at ordinary temperatures. In general terms, the reactions can be described as fusion when two hydrogen isotopes combine to form a single product nuclei or as transmutation when one or more hydrogen isotope nuclei enter a larger nuclei. As expected, these reactions generate energy but very little radiation is detected, which is unexpected and has been a cause for rejection. Sufficient evidence is now available to justify believing this is a real phenomenon and not the result of error. The challenge is to explain how such an unusual process operates. The approached used in this paper is based on six assumptions and their logical relationship to many observations. Although many details are not quantified, the general characteristics of the LENR process are described. This analysis places severe limits on any proposed explanation.",,,,,,

The method to form this environment and the nuclear consequences are described. The fusion process is proposed to occur when a form of metallic hydrogen is created in nano-cracks. Methods to test the model are provided. Engineering variables are identified and used to show how the process can be controlled and amplified.

"The LENR effect was identified 27 years ago by Profs. Fleischmann and Pons as production of extra energy in a normal chemical structure, in this case PdD. Over a thousand published papers now support the discovery and the energy is shown to result from fusion of hydrogen isotopes without the need to apply energy and without energetic radiation being produced. By conventional standards, the claims are impossible. Nevertheless, a new phenomenon has been discovered requiring acceptance and understanding. The major behaviors and their present understanding are described in this paper and are used to suggest how an effective explanation might be constructed. Once again, science has been forced to either reject the obvious or accept the impossible. In this case, the normal skepticism needs to be ignored in order to determine if this promised energy source is real and can provide the ideal energy so critically needed.",,,,,,

"Chemical energy alone has powered civilization until relatively recently when nuclear fission power based on uranium became available. Efforts are now underway to go the next step on this path to nuclear sources by harnessing fusion power using hydrogen. So far, this so-called hot fusion process has not been successful in producing practical power. The complexity and size of the generator is expected to make this source impractical even after the many engineering problems are solved. Perhaps a different approach is needed. As answer to this need, a new method called cold fusion was recently discovered to cause fusion. Even though this might prove to be a better way to extract fusion energy, the claim has been difficult for some scientists to accept because it conflicts with what is known about nuclear interaction. This paper describes the cold fusion claim and gives reasons why the method should be accepted and applied.",,,,,,

Production of the LENR effect involves achieving a large concentration of D in the PdD lattice structure. A great deal of effort has been applied to understanding how this can be accomplished and the nature of the resulting structure. The bulk properties play a role in this process but are sensitive to the impurity content and treatment. The influence of the bulk properties on this process has not been fully explored.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"This paper describes a new method to directly measure the bond energy between the PdH structure and the contained H atoms in real time as a function of H/Pd ratio from zero to the maximum H content using the electrolytic method and H2SO4+H2O to react Pd with H. A unique and very accurate calorimeter (+/-5 mW) is used to measure power during the loading reaction. This method is applied to several types of Pd including commercial Pd sheet, extra pure Pd, and a zone refine single-crystal of Pd after each is subjected to several treatments. These treatments include repeated loading-deloading cycles, annealing at 900°C, and reduction in thickness. The bond energy is found to be sensitive to purity, treatment, and H/Pd ratio, with good agreement with published measurements being achieved after certain treatments. In addition, three methods to measure the average H/Pd ratio are described and compared. These methods use weight gain, orphaned oxygen, and recombiner temperature. A great deal of information about the reaction process can be obtained by combining these three methods because they are sensitive to different possible errors and behaviours.",,,,,,

INTRODUCTION,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"Cold fusion (CF) was announced on March 23, 1989, by Dr. Martin Fleischmann and Dr. Stanley Pons. The immense potential energy benefits of CF were immediately recognized at the time. Humankind’s need for a source of cheap, clean, inexhaustible, and safe energy seemed to be realized. However, CF was rejected by mainstream science within a year or so, and it remains highly marginalized to this day. On the other hand, it has continued to be rigorously pursued by many capable investigators in several countries. It is now widely referred to as Low Energy Nuclear Reaction (LENR)",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"Many of the investigators who continued to pursue LENR in spite of the rejection began their work in the early years after the announcement. Now more than 30 years later many are leaving the field because of retirement or health issues. Because of the rejection and lack of funding, the researchers’ records have not been systematically recorded and preserved. At the same time, these records may eventually help understand LENR and achieve its benefits. Their loss would be a tragedy not only for the field, but also for humankind. . . .",,,,,,

"A brief description of selected information presently known about the fusion process called cold fusion is provided and used to support a general description of how the process is proposed to work. The nuclear process results from an unusual chemical condition in which a structure forms that can cause nuclear fusion when isotopes of hydrogen are present. This fusion process has two important features. It may be a source of clean, inexhaustible, and inexpensive energy. In addition, it has revealed a new kind of nuclear process. Although this proposed mechanism could not yet be described in mathematical detail, its major features can be identified and used as a guide for future studies.",,,,,,

"The application of transient cavitation bubbles, TCBs, in conjunction with metal foils has proved to be a good scientific probe or tool for the predictable measurements of excess heat Q(x) and heat-after Q(a) [ 1 ] at steady state temperatures. The TCB jet produces a high density coherent flux of D+ that is injected into the foil lattice with a flux density of about 1 024 D+/cm2 in a few pi co seconds and at 40 KHz billions of TCBs are formed on the lattice each second [2,3,4,5,6,7]. The data is measured at 5 min. intervals over a period of 24 hours in a static device with some 43 sonication runs and an equal number of calibration runs. A Joule heater is included in the piezo driven reactor to calibrate all runs. It was found from earlier unpublished work [2] that a number of foils will produce both Q(x) and Q(a) in D2O. The Q(a) is different in a mixture of light and heavy water. Q(a) is divided into two distinct processes; Q(al) involving j ust deuterons and the larger Q(a2) involving both deuterons and protons. The knowledge gained from 43 experiments reported on in this paper were completed in the period of Feb. to Apr. of 1 998. The energy values for Q(x) and Q(a) outputs vary from 40 KJ to mega Joules with rates that vary from 1 to 1 5 watts depending on the conditions. The one parameter that is not predictable at this point is the duration of Q(a).",,,,,,

The inertial compression of a jet via an electron induced magnetic field pinch effect on its plasma contents produces high to even higher deuteron densities in the order of 1025 gm/cc before implanting into a foil target. This model is parallel to the systems found in the hot plasmas of inertial systems. During the initial period of implantation of a few picoseconds, the high density deuterons in the target lattice experience reduced coulomb repulsion due to the high density charge screening. In this environment it is possible that some DD fusion events occur as evidenced by photos of the metal target foils and by the evidence of helium four and tritium production.",,,,,,

"Natural cavitation phenomena in D2O using piezo devices, is now amplified initiating DD fusion events that produce heat and helium. We have adapted it for our use. The transient cavitation bubble, TCB, has been harnessed to produce high densities of deuterons, 10^25 to 25/cc. An electrically driven piezo device filled with D2O produces acoustic field generating TCBs that are, in the final collapse stage, micro accelerators. The result is the implanting of deuterons into a target foil producing 4He originating from the Pd foil and T from the Ti foil. We are an emergent tangent technology to sonoluminescence, SL, technology, which we use to give us an environmental parameter probe into the bubble contents at the moment of its highest energy density. (Much of the SL studies center on the pulses of photons coupled to the irradiating acoustic field emanating from an oscillating single stable cavitation bubble, SSCB.) The generation of these photons relates to conditions for the target implantation process. Recently we have been studying the effects of frequency on multi TCB SL conditions that produce fusion. These experiments and the analytical methods have concentrated on the mass spectroscopy of reactor gases, calorimetry of the reactor and power supply, and the scanning electron microscope photographs of target foils. The results from many experiments are pieced together to reach a plausible path for the TCB that terminates with deuterons implanting into a target with the resulting fusion events. The use of SL for monitoring the bubble content’s high energy densities allows for reactor parameter management for fusion events in the target foil. Studies of multi TCBs' SL at higher temperatures (300-450ºK), external pressures (10^6-10^7.5 dynes/cm2) and frequencies (.02- 1.7 MHz) are proceeding in a search for better fusion environments. The results of these experiments will be presented.",,,,,,

"ABSTRACT We are using one of the most remarkable pulsing systems that nature offers for producing transient high energy densities and I have been fortunate enough to be involved with it for over 20 years. Over time we have increased the frequency of our piezo cavitation drivers and are now at 1.6 MHz and find that our results are the same. Even better, the Qx /(reactor gm), the energy density, is drastically increased when compared to our 40 and 20 KHz piezo systems [1,2,3]. The cost is decreased by at least an order of magnitude and the durability is greatly increased. All Q values in this paper are dQ/dt Joules/sec. or watts. The systems differ in several ways because of the 40 times increase in frequency. These 1.6 MHz systems produce more sonoluminescence, SL, and more but smaller bubbles and an energy density in the collapsing bubble system that is the same magnitude as the 40KHz systems [4,5]. . . .",,,,,,

The result of high density pinched implantation of D+ and e-, deuterons and electrons; plasma is a D+ cluster. The implant occurs in a picosecond time frame with a creation of D+/Pd, in a 100/1 ratio of an initially electron free D+ cluster with a diameter in the order of a hundred nm. The mobile e- react with D+ and surround the D+ cluster with D. DD fusion events occurring in the transient high-density cluster produce a gamma free heat pulse. The heat pulse reaches the lattice surface in a nanosecond expelling the vapor/liquid foil and products as ejecta. The ejecta sites are easily seen in SEM photos and are counted and plotted as MeV DD fusion events.

"Experimentally, heat and 4He are the fusion products of sonofusion (SF). SF controls a naturally occurring phenomenon with cavitation-induced bubbles and their high energy density transferred to transient jets that implant deuteron clusters into a matrix or lattice. The SF path to clusters can be extrapolated from high-density experiments of inertial confined fusion, ICF, Bose Einstein Condensates, BEC, muon fusion, MF, and astrophysical phenomena, to explain our ejecta sites, Qx, 4He, and no measureable long-range radiation results. The fusion events emanate from deuteron clusters implanted into target foils. Clusters are squeezed and cooled via electromagnetic, EM, compression pressures and evaporative cooling of cluster surface deuterons producing the fusion environment. Evidence of these cluster fusion events is found in the millions of target foil ejecta sites in",,,,,,

The electromagnetic, EM, pulse compressed deuteron clusters squeezing them into a Bose Einstein Condensate.

"Sonofusion experiments, which incorporate transient Bose Einstein condensates, BEC, have recently focused on related sonosuperconductivity. Cavitation jets implant high-density deuteron clusters into a target foil. Clusters are then squeezed by accelerated charges that form dense transient EM pulses. Cavitation and the associated sonoluminescence phenomena, used as a measuring tool, helps develop and explain related experimental results. Two outcomes, sonofusion and sono-superconductivity both produce D+clusters in reactors of different geometries. MHz reactor No. 1 is driven by a disk piezo and has produced excess heat, Qx, using the foil target and other products, including 4He. The newMHz reactor No. 2 is driven by a cylindrical piezo lowpower with a concentric wire target with transient cluster steady state concentration near the wire surface. The target’s steady state cluster coverage may satisfy a sono-superconductivity subsurface cluster connectivity during the MHz’s 100 ns collective sonoluminescence pulse. It was anticipated that ambient sono-superconductivity was possible but so far has proved difficult to measure. Cavitation D2O bubbles in both reactors were controlled by three main parameters for the two reactors: temperature, pressure of Ar gas over D2O, and acoustic watt input; Ti, Pi, andQa. The z-pinch jets’contents of deuterons and electrons were implanted, with an induced picosecond transient charge separation. This charge separation produced an electromagnetic, EM, cluster compression pulse that formed a high-density BEC environment, as the EM pulse pressure overwhelmed repulsive deuteron cluster pressure for that picosecond. This model used unique attributes of the high-density transient deuterons to produce sonofusion in reactor No. 1 and sono-superconductivity in reactor No. 2 near ambient temperature. The measurements showed the presence of sonoluminescence pulses, implanted plasma, and heat pulse ejecta sites.",,,,,,

Neither the characteristic gamma nor the neutron typically seen in the formation from two deuterons of 4He and 3He, respectively, is observed. The experimental arrangement is specified. A proposed model, based on cavitation-produced z-pinch jets in target-foil implants, is outlined. It involves formation in the implants of a BE condensate that provides the source of the deuterons and whose recoil ensures energy-momentum conservation. The model accounts for all experimental results. It also provides a guide for future work on sonofusion.",,,,,,

"The alphas formed in Ti and Pd target foils were measured as 4He in a mass spectrum, MS, analysis at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, PNNL, a lab that specializes in 3He and 4He measurements. The exposed bcc crystal lattice Ti target foil, TF, measured an average of 39 x 10^12 +/- 1.4 trapped 4He atoms. The fcc crystal lattices of Pd, Ag, Ni, and Cu target foils, particularly the two measured fcc Pd TF lattices produced ~ 0.35 x 10^12 trapped 4He atoms. This helium level was just above its background level, and 1/100 that of the bcc Ti TF. In the fcc palladium TF, SEM crater volume measurements show that most of the alphas are ejected into the circulating D2O, where they were measured in the gas phase. In 1994 the samples were run at LANL and measured at PNNL. The helium was measured by melting small TF pieces cut from the active center zone. Then each piece was placed in a crucible, and melted under vacuum, releasing all gases including background helium. These collected gases from one piece were pretreated; then were measured. The data was converted to total 4He atoms trapped in the active zone of the TF lattice. A total of 24 measurements for 3He and 4He on three TFs found no 3He but 4He in all 12 measurements. SEM photos of single ejecta sites were combined with calculations of old data that used knowledge gained from 23 years of cavitation experience that enhances the old data.",,,,,,

"This paper discusses Radio Frequency (RF) applied to cavitating D2O, resulting in jet plasma implantation of charged separated electrons and a deuteron-compressed plasma pulse; these interactions involved hot charged particles at an effective temperature of 104 K in a sub-picosecond time frame A. Free electrons were focused on clustered deuterons that compressed the deuterons like a spherical piston, squeezing a Meso-Cluster (MC) of deuterons. The compressed clusters were different from the deuterium clusters used by A. Takahashi. A reaction pathway similar to muon fusion was observed. The RF applied at a deuteron resonance, produced charge neutrality in the plasma’s electromagnetic (EM) pathway where alpha production was observed. Each MC consisted of 2–100 deuterons. Here we will use 10 deuterons to describe the MC and its alpha production, within time frame A. The changing MC density, pressure, and temperature were critical to alpha production, within time frame A. The MC volume was about 10-39 m3 and compression force was continuously applied to the MC located at the target foil (TF) surface. The heat transport was fast, and MCs were confined by electromagnetic fields (EM) tangent to the MC interface and motion of the neutralizing electrons. It is conjectured in this paper that the neutralizing plasma in time frame A produced a shockwave (SW) using a single electron to form a D atom that fused two deuterons in the MC to create an alpha. Before the fusion reaction, the surface target foil atoms were cavitating for an active period of 100 ns duration with each RF cavitation resonance cycle (see the main text in Fig 4). . . .",,,,,,

"Radio frequency (RF) cavitation of water using an RF amplifier has been under development for the last five years as a 2 MHz producer of high concentrations of small cavitation bubbles collapsing in water. There is little doubt that helium atoms were produced from RF at 2 MHz during cavitation of both DOD and HOH. The path for D to He looked much simpler, so the effort was placed there as the path for H to He appeared to be too complex. Measuring and finding He produced in a vacuum tight reactor with no air leaks where mass spectral (MS) system analyses numbers would be disturbed. The only He to deal with was in the reactor’s pressurizing tank of Ar and that value of 0.10 ppm was subtracted from all measurements. Two systems were analyzed. In one, HOH and Cu produced 1.7Wfor 45 min. and in system two, DOD and Pd/6% Ag produced a burst of 6 W for 250 s. A comparison was made between cavitation and muon systems. A very slow rate muon system also produced He. The two impulse systems, Isw and I mu, were compared, and the cavitating system’s impulse was 60 times greater than the muon system. The two systems differ. The cavitation system was explosive, and the muon system was implosive. The cavitation system was fueled by 15.5 eV of energy, and the muon system was fueled by 23.8×10^+6 eV of energy. The cavitation system reaction rate was 1.6×10^-15 s, and the muon system was 10-6 s. From this point of view the cavitation system looked more favorable than the muon system for He production.",,,,,,

"Two systems are presented in this paper: 1) describes the Radio Frequency, RF, reactor that produces alphas and 2) the polycarbonate reactor that produced sonoluminescence, SL or gammas several years earlier. During experiments, dV/dt rapid changes were noted in volumes of proton and deuteron capturing an electron as the initial temperature cools. This is a very basic event at the atomic level. The D+ + e-D* will produce a shockwave that is only compressive for the elemental hydrogen isotopes. The shock wave that destroys the MC cluster of deuterons in a squeezing process, ends with an explosion that excites the MC debris. An excited state occurs where a free MC deuteron combines with the D*forming an alpha as part of the debris system for that cycle. He4 was collected in the Ar gas phase for a mass spectroscopy analysis, MS. Only the 3 hydrogen isotopes have the potential of the large dV/dt compression.",,,,,,

"Old measurements of the sonoluminescence (SL) photons emitted during DOD cavitation fits RF experiments, and it was never thought He4 might be associated with SL. But a closer look makes a case that SL and gamma photons were the same. The RF system during DOD cavitation could be associated with the improbable equation 2D He4 + g. The measured SL fits the RF He4 MS measurements. The advantage of the RF amplifier driven system was its freedom of a locked frequency of the oscillator driven systems and can be frequency tuned while running. The system could be tuned off for 5 s temperature measurement in the 30 s run mode, thus avoiding the high RF field interference to thermocouple measurements. This SWsystem was impressed with Lawandy’s like charge attractive forces system that was compatible with MC SW system making the experiments that yield other He4 paths. These were single events of a few atoms, with high activity electrons for a short time, during a 2-MHz cycle.",,,,,,

"The controversy about Cold Fusion ""CF"" depends on the fact that the phenomena discovered are not in agreement with present physical theories, like QM and QED. The aim of this paper is to show that a. Time-Space-Oscillation `TSO' connected to matter is a physical perspective able to explain CF and the Particle-Wave-Duality, even able to propose technical means for further development. According to this perspective a particle -even at rest- is joined to a real, centripetal TSO, a 'de Broglie oscillation', instead of a mathematical Schrödinger wave function1). This TSO-field propagates with velocity c toward a focus, where the particle is created as a flickering wave vertex, that can push an instrument trigger. Particles and nuclides including their Coulomb barriers, thus become endowed with phase dependency and a centripetal wave field, that can interfere in slits. This explains the Particle-Wave Duality and why the Coulomb barrier can be tunneled under certain phase conditions.. This TSO-perspective further hints at nuclear reactions of a 'centripetal' kind different from those based on 'translational collisions', described by present high energy physics. It is worth consideration because it gives accurate accounts",,,,,,

"This paper reports on the impact of an applied magnetic field intensity on LANR solution electrical resistance and an analysis of its role in metal deuteride loading and LANR performance. A dual anode PHUSOR®-type Pd/D2O/Au LANR device was driven at its optimal operating point, with two electrical current sources; to drive, and examine by 4-terminal electrical resistance, the loaded PdDx cathode. An applied magnetic field ~0.3 T increases the LANR solution’s electrical resistance ~10-17% with a time constant in minutes. The incremental resistance increase to an applied H-field is greatest at low loading current. The incremental resistance increase from an applied H-field is greatest with the applied H-field perpendicular to the driving electrical field (E-field) intensity. The modified LANR deuteron loading rate equation indicates that an applied magnetic field intensity increases deuteron loading in a LANR system by the increasing solution resistance and limiting undesired gas evolving reactions.",,,,,,

"In lattice-assisted nuclear reactions (LANR, or LENR), the size and structural metamaterial shape of Pd-D nanostructures, and the deuterium flux through them all play decisive roles. The spiral Phusor®-type cathode system with open helical cylindrical geometry in a high electrical resistance solution is a LANR metamaterial design creating an unusual electric field distribution and requisite intrapalladial deuteron flow. Optimal operating point (OOP) technology allows improved and more reproducible operation. LANR power gain can be considerable. In situ imaging has revealed that the excess power gain is linked to non-thermal near-IR emission when the LANR devices are operated at their OOP.",,,,,,

The Series VI two terminal device featured new composition, structure, and superior handling properties. Most importantly it was preloaded so that LANR activation is separated from loading. The calorimeter had parallel diagnostics, including heat flow measurement, and calibrations included an ohmic (thermal) control located next to the NANOR-type device. The preloaded LANR device demonstrated energy gain which ranged generally from 5 to 16. It was 14.1 energy gain while the MIT IAP course was ongoing. During February and March, through a range of experiments, the NANOR continued to produce excess energy, confirmed by daily calibrations. This open demonstration has confirmed the existence, reproducibility, and improved control of CF/LANR reactions, and as importantly, has shown a possibly superior preloaded nanostructured LANR material and driving device.",,,,,,

"Previously, we reported that such nanocomposite ZrO2–PdNiD LANR materials have been made into LANR/CF transistors which exhibit energy gain and simultaneous non-thermal near infrared emission. This is accompanied by complicated polarization/transconduction phenomena including an avalanche transconduction electrical breakdown, which has a critical role in excess heat generation. This paper presents a new generation of preloaded LANR (CF) activated nanocomposite ZrO2–PdNiD CF/LANR quantum electronic devices capable of energy gain. These devices dry, glued into electrically conductive, sealed, configurations. The core is ZrO2–(PdNiD) with additional D2 and H2. They are self-contained CF/LANR quantum electronic components containing ZrO2–PdNi–D LANR/CF nanostructured materials which generate significant excess heat from applied electric fields. They also feature two terminals and self-contained superior handling properties enabling portability and transportability. Most importantly, the activation of the desired LANR reactions is, for the first time, separated from the loading of the substrate. Although their development has required control of their breakdown states and the quenching tendencies of nanostructured materials, these ZrO2–PdNiD CF/LANR quantum electronic devices are potentially very useful because they are reproducible active nanostructured CF/LANR quantum electronic devices.",,,,,,

"A high voltage electron irradiator was used to generate high vacancy content VP metal samples. High Frenkel defects (FD) content (vacancy phase) metal samples of Pd and Ni were generated by a single treatment with a high voltage electron irradiator (2.5 MV electrons, 2500 Gray/s dose rate, single portal, 1.50–3.0 megaGray midplane dose) at room temperature. These irradiationsynthesized, vacancy-phase (ISVP) metals were examined for their room-temperature annealing rate using four-terminal conductivity measurements. We show that high dose rate supervoltage irradiated palladium and nickel can achieve saturation densities of defects at the level of a few tenths percent and that level can be followed with the appearance of lattice quakes repairing the damage. The most heavily irradiated samples developed incremental electrical resistivities of ""4 µ!-cm, with rapid recovery consistent with room-temperature annealing. The early labile vacancy phase state of ISVP metals has a half-life ""2.5 h. Lattice quakes are observed when electrical transconduction spectroscopy is used to monitor the lattice healing and vacancy recombination. The irradiation produced an effective increase in the cross-sectional area of the palladium wires (99.98%) pure) of ""2.5% at 3 megaGray delivered, consistent with the literature.",,,,,,

We report the response of such active components to steady and dynamic applied magnetic field intensities up to 1.5 T changing with a 0.1 ms rise time. Power gain was determined by the triple verified system of dT/Pin, HF/Pin, and calorimetry. Fractionated magnetic fields have a significant, unique amplification effect. Residual, late-appearing effects are complex. Importantly, at higher input electrical currents, high intensity fractionated magnetic fields demonstrate their own, new optimal operating point (OOP) manifold curve. This suggests that cold fusion (LANR) is the first stage, and may be mediated by other than phonons.",,,,,,

There was a fall-off in pit count with increasing distance from the operating system. Most interestingly, the CR-39 over the device essentially imaged the active CF/LANR device at very low resolution. Large tracks were the most effective for imaging. Smaller and mid-sized tracks appear to be useful for measuring fall off of the chip irradiation as a function of distance. The conclusion is that CF/LANR is a nuclear process, and for this system at this power level, the quantitative amount is measurable in a spatial, controllable, pattern.",,,,,,

"Cold fusion nanomaterials, in general, and NANOR R-type LANR components (derived from them), in particular, have two distinct regions of performance on each side of the electrical avalanche. This had lead to the identification of three (3) distinct regions of their electrical operation. We now report that the optimal power gain of NANOR R-type cold fusion components is found far below the breakdown voltage and that the power gain decreases continuously as the electrical avalanche threshold is approached. Beyond the region of electrical avalanche, the previously active preloaded LANR quantum electronic components then give a thermal output similar to a standard ohmic control (a carbon composition resistor). Therefore, use of this technique of driving an active CF/LANR nanomaterial component into, and beyond, their avalanche threshold, provides verification of the excess heat an additional way, which confirms that the calorimetry was calibrated. Also, this investigation indicates where, on the input power axis, to drive them for a maximum effective use. We also report that deuterium can fuel nanomaterial ZrO2–Ni systems, consistent with the previously report involving aqueous CF/LANR systems by Swartz et al. (ICCF-9).",,,,,,

"Volume-enhanced Coherent Multi-wavelength Optical Reflection Electric-driven (CMORE) spectroscopy successfully differentiates active states in LANR nanomaterials. All the anti-Stokes peaks are relatively missing in the undriven mode for all of the nanostructured materials. Weak anti-Stokes peaks are elicited from Pd (and Ni and their alloy) nanostructured material in ZrO2. But when NANOR-type components are electrically driven, there is diversity in outcome. When driven in the avalanche mode, the anti-Stokes peaks differ considerably from those which appear during the excess heat (XSH)-producing or desired mode. The anti-Stokes peak(s) differ in energy, amount, and in what stimulates their appearance. However, normal anti-Stokes peaks return when the electrical drive creates ""avalanche mode"" characterized by higher electrical current at decreasing voltage. The avalanche anti-Stokes peaks are many, and they are lower energy than the XSH mode produced anti-Stokes peak (described main text). By contrast, successful cold fusion is heralded by a large increase in the anti-Stokes to Stokes (aS/S) ratio, and the generated anti-Stokes peak for the desired and XSH-producing state is very different from the avalanche-generated multiple anti-Stokes peaks. That XSHrelated peak is singular and at higher energy. This distinguishing, higher energy, single, anti-Stokes peak is also not seen in the ""off"" state or the avalanche (undesirable) mode. Our analysis finds that the excess-heat produced anti-Stokes peak is matched to the Stokes line of PdD. We also find that the several lower energy anti-Stokes in avalanche mode (unsuccessful regarding CF/LANR) are matched to the many Stokes peaks for zirconia. In the desired electric-driven XSH-producing mode, the two-terminal deuterided NANORr-type CF/LANR component has a measured Boltzmann Stokes ratio ~1.3. Analysis of the phonon gain heralds ~7^+/- 0 15 acoustic phonons assisting nuclear reactions and a core peak calculated Stokes temperature of circa 1645 K. Therefore, these findings confirm a role for PdD acoustic phonons in successful CF/LANR.",,,,,,

This is demonstrated by presenting calorimetry and other measurements of both modes during a single run, and by confirmation using CMORE spectroscopy.

This is potentially a very important source of energy because the techniques shown here, can increase the excess energy gain of CF/LANR reactions by at least 410%. In addition, by monitoring both the calorimetry and the Voc, detailed knowledge of the deuteron distribution and flows within the palladium are revealed. These experiments revealed that initially only one in 2300 deuterons takes part in the desired reactions of HAD excess enthalpy production, for a net utilization of 0.04% of the loaded deuterons at that time. This decreases over time. Integrated over the entire HAD regime, this deuteron participation levels falls, and eventually only 1 in 106 deuterons participates in the desired fusion reactions.",,,,,,

"The dielectric breakdown of water under static fields has been studied by i-V relation for 6 metals. The relations are quasi-linear up to a current density of a few A/cm^2. The limiting current continues for a few volts to a few hundred volts, depending on the metal. a glow develops at the electrode and becomes continuous at the end of the plateau, where the cd increases irregularly(breakdown). The breakdown potential does not depend on the field in the water. It occurs at about the same cd for most metals. When electrolytes are added, the cell potential at the breakdown is increased. Adsorbed layers and organic coatings increase the breakdown potential. Electrical energy storage in water is increased by ~10 times by coatings. The breakdown potential decreases with increase of the log of rate constant for H evolution on the various electrodes and with corresponding work function. The cell potentials for breakdown correspond to fields in the dielectric below that needed to dissociate it. The limiting current is caused by the formation of a H2-steam layer at the interface, which causes increase in the electrode potential at constant current. The H2-steam layer plasmolyzes. When the Fermi level in the cathode reaches the conduction band of water, electrons enter the water and remain stable therein. They interact nonadiabatically with water and are .the head of streamers. An analogous model holds for holes in the valence band. ""Dielectric breakdown"" depends on the Fermi level of the electrons in the condenser plate and the semiconductor characteristics of water. It can be eliminated by modifying the electrode surface.",,,,,,

ABSTRACT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"Recently, Fleischmann et al. [1] reported that nuclear events can occur when deuterium is electrochemically compressed within the Pd-lattice. These events were reported to produce excess enthalpy, tritium, and neutrons. The exact nature of these events and the conditions leading to their initiation are poorly understood. In fact, the existence of such events is questioned by many [2]. The present position among those investigating this problem [3] is as follows: enthalpy production is a non-steady state process whose rate depends on the nature of the electrode material; however, the observed steady state production arises from an averaging of small perturbations. Nuclear events are believed to occur on the electrode surface as well as within the electrode interior.",,,,,,

Effects of the choice of rate constants of the elementary steps and the charging current on the surface coverage, the electrode potential and the time required to complete electrode charging are examined.",,,,,,

ABSTRACT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
The mode of deuterium uptake during Pd-D co-deposition has been explored using galvanostatic perturbation techniques. The resultant potential relaxation curves exhibit four distinct potential—time intervals where the relaxation process is controlled by the interaction between the transport of deuterium from the lattice to the surface to form adsorbed deuterium and the reduction of palladium from solution. These interactions are discussed in terms of the palladium + electrolyte interphase.,,,,,,

INTRODUCTION,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"These introductory remarks illustrate the controversial climate that existed when the NRaD program investigated the anomalous effects the Pd/D system exhibited. These effects included, among others, excess enthalpy production at rates exceeding those usually associated with chemical reactions. The controversy concerns the origin of the observed excess enthalpy which, according to Fleischmann and Pons, is due to room temperature nuclear events involving deuterons present within the Pd lattice, hence, the term cold fusion. To avoid unnecessary arguments, this report refers to the phenomenon as the Fleishmann-Pons (FP) effect.",,,,,,

"ABSTRACT Processes associated with the Pd + D alloy codeposition are examined by cyclic voltammetry. The voltammograms cover the potential range: +0.3 to -1.3 V (measured against an Ag/AgCl/KCl (sat) reference) and indicate that the partial current due to the Pd2+ ion reduction is diffusion limited at slow scan rates. Except for the significant increase in cathodic currents due to D2O reduction at ca. -0.25 V which occurs on a freshly generated Pd surface, the shapes of the voltammograms marginally differ from those recorded in the absence of Pd2+ ions in the electrolyte phase. A discussion of the dynamics of the interphase is presented.",,,,,,

"In the Pd+D codeposition process, palladium is electrodeposited in the presence of evolving deuterium. This process favors the initiation and propagation of nuclear and thermal events through a rapid absorption of deuterium to yield high D/Pd atomic ratios. This process results in the formation of non-equilibrium electrode structures that become the seat for localized gradients. Evidence for tritium production, X-ray emanation and generation of localized heat sources, with emphasis on experimental methodology, is provided. The active role of the electrode/electrolyte interphase in the development of these events is examined.",,,,,,

"ABSTRACT Evidence for tritium production in the Pd/D system under cathodic polarization is presented. A comparison of the observed distribution and that calculated, based upon the conservation of mass, leads to the conclusion that tritium is produced sporadically at an estimated rate of ca 103-104 atoms per second. The results of several runs are interpreted by employing the concept of an electrode/electrolyte interphase and the accepted kinetics of hydrogen evolution. Observation of burst-like events followed by longer periods of inactivity yield poor reproducibility when distributions are averaged over the total time of electrolysis.",,,,,,

It is shown, by energydispersive X-ray method, that the needed energy is provided by nuclear events occurring in the region close to the electrode surface.

"Almost two decades ago, Fleischmann and Pons reported excess enthalpy generation in the negatively polarized Pd/D-D2O system, which they attributed to nuclear reactions. In the months and years that followed, other manifestations of nuclear activities in this system were observed, viz. tritium and helium production and transmutation of elements. In this report, we present additional evidence, namely, the emission of highly energetic charged particles emitted from the Pd/D electrode when this system is placed in either an external electrostatic or magnetostatic field. The density of tracks registered by a CR-39 detector was found to be of a magnitude that provides undisputable evidence of their nuclear origin. The experiments were reproducible. A model based upon electron capture is proposed to explain the reaction products observed in the Pd/D-D2O system.",,,,,,

"Scientists at the US Navy SPAWAR Systems Center-Pacific (SSC-Pacific), and its predecessors, have had extraordinary success in publishing LENR papers in peer-reviewed journals. This success hasn’t come easily and is due to several factors. One key reason for this success was the courage of the SSC-Pacific upper management in allowing scientists to conduct research and publish results in a controversial field. The few journal editors, who had the fortitude to consider our work, also contributed to this success. This contrasts with the majority of their peers who, taking the path of least resistance, ignored our work out of hand and returned manuscripts with, ‘the subject matter is not in the purview of the journal'. The reviewers also played a role in the successful publication of LENR-related papers. A multitude of reviewers, many outside the LENR field, had to put aside their biases and look objectively at our data. In turn, the reviewers' relentless concerns forced us to tenaciously address their issues. Ultimately, the SSC-Pacific team published 21 refereed papers in seven journals and a book chapter, spanning 19 years beginning in 1989. This paper is a brief synopsis of those publications.",,,,,,

He was respected for his expertise and knowledge by many including Dr. Martin Fleischmann and Dr. John Bockris with whom he shared many private communications both before and after the 1989 Fleischmann-Pons announcement that became known as ""cold fusion"" or Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR). Stan quickly applied his expertise toward understanding the underlying processes involved. One of his first contributions, which has been widely used, is the use of codeposition to prepare the cathode. LENR is a very complex problem and Stan recognized that it was not going to be solved during his lifetime so he decided to document his thoughts in a book.",,,,,,

This is done by negatively polarizing the system which (i) starts the process of self-organization, i.e. development of coherent processes involving protons/deuterons and lattice defects to produce the pre-nuclear active state and (ii) creates conditions for the electron capture by proton/deuteron reaction to occur. The low energy neutrons transform the pre-nuclear active state into an active state, i.e. display of features such as hot spots, transmutation and particle emission which, in turn, yields information on participating reactions and processes.",,,,,,

"This research develops the Least Action Nuclear Process (LANP) model of cold fusion, by assuming that the process is thermodynamically reversible. This requires: 1) one element of new physical theory, a far-from-equilibrium blackbody equation having a second temperature scale, and 2) a nuclear reaction selection method based in the Principle of Least Action. The model appears to predict nuclear transmutations observed in MileyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nickel microspheres, without false positives, and provides a plausible explanation of loading and ignition processes, excess heat, no excess heat, and the absence of gamma radiation. The model shows how solar core temperatures can exist in a laboratory temperature device. The presentation is abstracted from a larger technical paper.",,,,,,

"The Open Gate Phenomenon is a unique solid-state mechanism that results in a significant and sustained electron transfer from an n-type semiconductor to Schottky metal particles that are grown from the semiconductor substrate itself. This results in a unique interface that acts as a one-way (rectifying) open gate. First identified in reduced polycrystalline titanium dioxide (an n-type semiconductor) to Group VIII metal particles, the interface significantly affects the Schottky barrier height resulting in electron flow into the metal particles from the reduced titanim dioxide (TiO2) based on their respective work functions. The result is a negative charge on the metal particles which is of sufficient magnitude and duration to provide cathodic protection of the metal particles from surface oxidation. In essence, the metal particles behave as a negatively charged electrode without an externally supplied power source.",,,,,,

Very weak neutron emission was detected to show an inversely proportional correlation to the excess heat variation.

"The excess heat measured for the use of charcoal cathode in the electrolysis of heavy water reached about 150% of the input power by preparing a notched hole in the surface of the cathode. The experimental condition was as follows. The cathode used was very hard charcoal. The anode was 0.3mm Pt wire. The electrolyte was 50cc of D20 or H20 with 0.25N LiOH.The anode and the cathode were set up in the electrol'yte so as the Pt wire to locate near the diameter of the hole. Making a hole as small as 0.3mm produced excess heat of 70%.Making a notch at the hole edge enhanced the excess heat higher than 100%. The excess heat for the use of H20 was about a half of that for D20. The current showed oscillation when the excess heat was large.A SEM examining of the charcoal showed that many uniform holes,as small as 1 micron, distributed inside the vessels are responsible for this anomalous increase in the excess heat.",,,,,,

"Summary results of 5 years study are presented about excess heat and nuclear products by three kinds of experiments, namely open-cell D20/Pd electrolysis, closed-cell D2O/Pd electrolysis and D-beam implantation experiments. Positive results for excess heat generation were obtained for 7 out of 3 1 experiments. No direct correlation between excess heat and radiations (neutrons and X-rays) were observed. Two clear and four marginal positive results for He-4 production were obtained in 1 1 closed-cell experiments. Proposed model of coherently-induced 3D fusion in metal-deuteride, for underlying physics of cold fusion, was first-time confirmed by D-beam implantation into highly D-Ioaded TiDx sample. Nuclear products of ""calm"" 3D and 4D fusions are concluded to be Li-6 and He-4.",,,,,,

"This paper shows that there are two kinds of excess heat, the one is by the electrolysis and the other is by the immersion of the charcoal in hot water heated higher than 90°C. The both phenomena suggested much about the mechanism of the excess heat. Various data of excess heat including as high as 250 % were obtained for the former method for the drilled charcoal cathode by concentrating the current. It was found that there were strong correlation between the data and the each temperature rise in the beginning short time, suggesing that the excess heat is due to the same mechanism. Throughout the many experiments it was recognized that the active bubbling is essential for the excess heat creation, so another experiments as stated by the immersion type was tried. As expected the excess heat was detected also. From the both experiments, microdrops-in-bubble model was proposed for the excess heat and cold fusion.",,,,,,

"This paper shows why and how the microdrops-in-bubble model explain the excess heat and the cold fusion. The thermodynamic properties of the micro drops in a bubble,where the pressure is 1 atm, is represented by Laplace's equation, i.e. the pressure(P)-volume(V) curves for various temperatures and the pressure-temperature(T) curves for various volume are drawn. The P-V and P-T curves demand the presence of the surface structure of the liquid and is named here as super water. The P-T curve shows a negative slope increasing as the volume decreases.This property is analysed by the third Maxwell's thermodynamic equation that the entropy is negative . When a microdrop receives a negative pressure the phase change from the normal water to the super water occurs and heat is generated. As the actuation is not by energy,the heat is excess heat. This occurs in both light and heavy water. The cold fusion arises in the minimum microdrop of heavy water under high actuation,as the super liquid is supposed to be liquid plasma and violent concussion is given there. Another effect of the negative pressure to the microdrop is to make it work by increasing the volume like an engine. An actuated microdrop synthesizes a new material whose resolution heat is equivalent to that released in the absence of the synthesis.",,,,,,

"A conservative modeling and analysis were attempted to explain the presence of nonradioactive fission-like products with nonnatural isotopic ratios observed in some D2O/Pd electrolysis experiments. The collective deformation of a Pd nucleus by multiphoton E1 resonance absorption in a dynamic PdDx lattice was assumed to induce low-energy photofissions via the selective scission channels within the lowest band (11-20 MeV) of channel-dependent fission barriers. Values of channel dependent fission barriers were calculated by using liquid drop model potentials for Pd isotopes. Fission products were analyzed in detail. Major fission products (FPs) are stable isotopes and the isotopic ratios of FP elements are very different from those of natural abundances.

[Denki Kagaku 64 (1996) 1660] and others in terms of Z-distribution, mass distribution and isotopic ratios.

"The present paper makes deepened modeling for the mechanism of transient Bose-type condensation for 4D and 8D clusters with electrons from Pd 4d-shell in PdDx lattice dynamics. Formation of quadruplet e*(4,4) electronic quasi-particle and octal-coupling e*(8,8) around lattice focal points with D-clusters which realize super screening for d-d and d-cluster Coulomb barrier is modeled for tetrahedral and octahedral symmetric condensations and discussed. Based on the electronic quasi-particle expansion theory (EQPET), modal fusion rates which are composed of 2D, 3D, 4D and 8D fusion rates with characteristic values for each mode are estimated for the tetrahedral and octahedral symmetric condensations. Based on given modal fusion rates we can estimate macroscopic cluster fusion rates (f/s/cc) by knowing time-averaged values of D-cluster densities. Several to few hundreds w/cc level fusion rates for 4D and 8D can be foreseen with major ash of 4He and a variety of secondary transmutation reactions, and neutron production rate by 2D fusion will be with 10-12 orders smaller magnitude than that of 4He production. Neutrons are therefore hardly visible in deuteron cluster fusion in condensed matter.",,,,,,

The increasing trend of yield ratios in lower energy region than 100 keV for deuteron4), suggests that the enhanced 3D reactions were not attributed to the direct reactions with incident d-beam, but to the indirect 3D fusion out of the slowing down range of the beam.",,,,,,

Production ratios of 3He/4He for multi-body fusion reactions in H/D mixed TSC systems are calculated as a function of H/D mixing rate. The model is further extended to treat direct nuclear interactions between host-metal nucleus and TSC of pure 4 protons (or 4 deuterons), since TSC can become very small (far less than 1 pm radius) charge-neutral pseudo-particle. Results for the case of Ni + 4p/TSC are discussed with Ni + p capture reactions and Ni + 4p fission reactions.",,,,,,

"This is a review of our studies on theoretical model of deuteron cluster fusion in condensed matter. Considering a transient condensation process of deuteron-cluster in focal points of metal-deuteride lattice, electron screening effect was theorized by the Electronic Quasi-Particle Screening Theory (EQPET) model for a transient deuteron cluster associating attracted electrons. Multibody resonance fusion of deuterons was proposed by modeling charged-pion exchange for strong interaction in very condensed deuteron cluster to lead to select the tetrahedral resonance fusion (TRF) of 4D and octahedral resonance fusion (ORF) of 8D as possible major reaction channels in extreme case. 4He is the final product of TRF and ORF. Tritium and 3He was suggested as minor products from 3D multi-body fusion. Visible but very small level production of neutron by D + D (2D) fusion was also concluded. Further extension of EQPET model is given to propose a dynamic Bose-type condensation process by orthogonally coupled two D2 molecules, which play a role of super screening of Coulomb barrier with quadruplet electronic quasi-particle to generate clean fusion product of 4He.",,,,,,

"The theoretical models on Condensed Cluster Fusion in the dynamic ordering process of deuterons in condensed matter (especially PdDx lattice) have been elaborated in three steps in the period from 1989 to 2009. The present paper briefly reviews theoretical modeling, mathematical formulation and quantitative estimations of multi-body deuteron fusion rates, time-dependent screening effect by electron clouds, and time-dependent size of condensing clusters as 4D/TSC. TSC is the tetrahedral symmetric condensate and key idea for clustering and dynamic condensation. Final products of 4D fusion are mainly 4He nuclei with 2-5 MeV main component and 23.8 MeV minor component.",,,,,,

"The PdO-coated layer of Pd-nano-particle may arrange fractal nano-dips on its surface when D(H)-gas is charged and de-oxidation molecules (D2Oor H2O) are released. Fractal nano-dips may make local deep adsorption potentials, through which rapid penetration of D-atoms (ions) into deeper Pd-local lattice (Bloch potential) O-sites of nano-particle may be induced, to realize full or over-full D(H) loaded state (x >1.0) of PdDx in a short time of the Phase-I process. Formation of D-clusters, such as 4D/TSC on surface may be enhanced at nano-dips. A phenomenological model of quasi-free D-motion under constraint of the Bloch potential within a global mesoscopic potential well is proposed for the Phase-II phenomena, where nuclear heating by 4D fusion reactions may rather steadily take place. Generation of collective mesoscopic potential well (CMPW) will make a Pd nano-particle with PdO working as ""mesoscopic catalyst"" which realizes very large D(H)-loading ratios and anomalously large chemical heat releases both for H-gas and D-gas loading.",,,,,,

"Various cases of possible orthodox nuclear reaction processes, including newly proposed 4H/TSC fusion by simultaneous weak and strong interactions, 4H/TSC + Ni induced fission products, Ni + p reactions and reaction by deuteron impurity, are comparatively discussed for feasibility.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"(1) Ni + p nuclear reaction is impossibly difficult to make the Coulomb-field penetration of proton through so many inner electron shells (K, L, M), usually non-active in chemical reactions, of Ni-atom. Also the proton capture with Ni-nucleus, if any with kW level power, should emit lethal prompt gamma-rays which have never been observed. So, this type of nuclear reactions is unlikely.",,,,,,
(2) Deuteron impurity (1/6700 in H2 gas usually) may induce (3H+D)/TSC fusion to be considered. Conditioning of 3-dimensional symmetry of QM-wave function for TSC is however of problem to condense into microscopic neutral entity small enough for causing any strong interactions.,,,,,,
"(3) The newly proposed 4H/TSCWS (weak-strong interaction simultaneously) fusion is a plausible scenario to have clean products (3He and proton, or deuterons) with significantly enhanced reaction rates in Ni nano-particles, for rare-conditioned (as discussed) visible heat generation with very weak secondary neutrons (10-13 order of 3He primary product) and gamma-rays (10-11 order of 3He primary product). Degrees of the generation rate of 4H/TSC (t = 0) transient clusters in Ni-H nano-particles and the life-time elongation of 4H/TSC-minimum state are speculatively studied. The auto-recovery capability of Ni nano-catalyst is considered as the key.",,,,,,
"(4) The 4H/TSC + Ni-isotope capture-and-fission process, previously proposed in our paper of JCMNS 1 (2007) 86-96 is another plausible scenario, to result in generation of clean fission products in A < 60 mass region. More enhanced 4p + Ni to fission rates than the previous prediction is expected due to the possible elongation of 4H/TSC-minimum-state life time without complete nuclear break-up of the symmetric cluster under dynamic condensation.",,,,,,

"The condensed matter nuclear reactions (CMNR) are thought to happen for trapped H(D) particles within some chemical (electromagnetic) potential well with finite lifetime. As the lifetime is much longer than the collision time of two-body interaction of free particles, the CMNR reaction rates are significantly (of the order of 19–20 in magnitude) enhanced if we compare with estimated reactions rates by the two-body collision formula. The basis of CMNR rate theory is reviewed in this paper by extracting essence of the TSC theory tools developed until now. Derivation of Fermi’s golden rule with nuclear optical potential, rate formulas by Born–Oppenheimer wave function separation, estimation of bracket integral of inter-nuclear strong interaction rate, estimation of time dependent barrier penetration probability by the HMEQPET method for dynamic D(H)-cluster condensation/collapse process, and DD fusion power levels as functions of inter-nuclear d–d distance and effective existing (life) time are given. A DD fusion power level of 10 kW/mol-dd-pairs is possible for a 1 pm inter-nuclear d–d distance with 10 ato-seconds lifetime. The level of 2.8 nano-mol 4D/TSC formations/s may release 10 kW neutron-free heat-power with 4He ash.",,,,,,

"Recent results on anomalous heat effect (AHE) by interaction of binary nano-composite metal powders and H (or D) gas, after the NEDO-MHE project (2015–2017) are the subject of this paper. The Pd–Ni10/zirconia (PNZ10) and Cu–Ni7/zirconia (CNZ7) powders by melt-spun and calcination method were for AHE active material samples, and were re-used by additional calcination. An amount of 80–400 W/kg level excess thermal power Wex of sustainable continuity for several weeks has been reproducibly observed at elevated temperature around 300?C, by using re-calcined PNZ-type samples with D-gas, significantly in net D-gas desorption mode. Specific reaction energy (?-value) per D-transferred was very large as from 100 eV/D to 500 eV/D. Very weak (0.1–0.2 n/J level) neutron emission looked correlating with the rise-up heat burst of thermal power after joule heating started. These results can be of the circumstantial evidence of the AHE by the nano-metal D-gas interaction. Data of 50-140 W/kg level excess thermal power was repeatedly obtained by CNZ-type samples with H-gas at elevated temperatures after the saturation of H-gas absorption (endothermic) by sample. Excess thermal power of ca. 50–70 W continued for more than two weeks by 505 g CNZ7r (re-calcined) sample, with very strange evolution of the cooled-flat and oscillating TC4 RC upper flange temperatures. . . . .",,,,,,

"We propose and numerically investigate a scheme to provide high-density optical or electromagnetic energy to fuel materials for condensed matter nuclear fusion. Surface plasmons in metal nanoparticulates strongly interact with electromagnetic fields at their resonance, resulting in an intense focusing of the incident energy around the metal surface. It is therefore possible to take the advantage of such high energy concentration, under laser or electric power input, for instance by simply coating the conventional Pd-based fuel materials with noble-metal nanoparticles or nanoshells. This field-enhancement effect can be a powerful method to boost the fusion-triggering electromagnetic or optical energy to significantly improve the reaction rate and experimental reproducibility, and to create low-D-load fusion systems. Importantly, this enhancement scheme is applicable to both gas- and liquid-phase systems, and furthermore, not only for laser/optical power, but also for the conventional electrolysis systems due to the equivalency between light and electromagnetic fields. We also show that the conventional fusion-catalyzing metals of Pd, Ni, and Ti themselves intrinsically exhibit a certain degree of field enhancement for their nanostructured form. Therefore, we point out that this plasmonic effect may have been unknowingly produced particularly in the electrolysis-type fusion experiments reported so far. This field-enhancement phenomenon thus could be a clue to solve the mystery of the energy supplied to overcome the gigantic Coulomb barrier to produce the fusion reaction observed with visible rates, as well as a powerful tool for further technical progress.",,,,,,

Importantly, this plasmonic enhancement occurs in the case of an optical-power incidence as well as an electric-bias application.

"An enhancing mechanism of nuclear fusions is presented, most part of which is within the framework of the traditional theories. In this mechanism, electron currents play an important role, which are induced by an externally applied field or counterstreams of free electrons which naturally exist inside, surface and outside of bulk metals. At places of electron currents, the electric potential becomes negative and there relevant nuclei gather and collide. Then, if electrons exist in close vicinities in addition, there the electric potential barriers are lowered further and the tunneling effects which bring about nuclear fusions drastically increase. Resultantly, the rate of nuclear fusions enhances as a whole. Then, if shape of the current can be sufficiently fine and strong the increase is more drastic. It is not clear that at present the mechanism can make enhance the fusion to any extent",,,,,,

This model is based on two new phenomena: the tunnel disintegration of an ionized deuterium molecule and the subsequent dipole disintegration of a deuteron. We calculated the probabilities of the neutron emission from condensed matter by considering the mechanisms of the dipole disintegration, especially the transition from the ground state to the decaying state. The results of the numerical calculation can successfully explain the important features of the neutron energy spectrum : the 2.45-MeV peak, the high-energy component at 3 ~ 7 MeV, and the large Tin ratio. This indi cates that the 2.45-MeV neutrons can be predicted by the dipole disintegration of the deuteron instead of the d-d nuclear fusion.",,,,,,

"We have tried to obtain evidence for electrolytically induced cold nuclear fusion by detecting charged particles associated with the nuclear reaction. Charged particles were detected by a conventional silicon surface barrier detector attached close to the thin foil cathode which formed the bottom of an electrolysis cell. The efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio of this system are higher than those of neutron detection systems, which made it easy to determine whether the fusion occurred or not. The energy spectrum measured with the electrolysis of D2O suggested that the nuclear reaction took place in palladium cathode.",,,,,,

"Internal structures of charged particle bursts induced by the D2O electrolysis have been studied by use of a fast response measurement system. Charged particles were detected by a NE102a plastic scintillation counter. The electrolysis was continued at low temperature at 4°C for 3 hours. After then, the cell was warmed up to several ten degrees of Celsius scale. During the warming-up, we caught some anomalous pulse emissions of charged particles. The pulse shapes of the bursts were found to be complicated and the duration of the bursts was distributed from 40 to 100 nanosecond . Comparison of these pulse shapes and standard response for a single particle suggests that the burst is a pile-up pulse and consists of many particles.",,,,,,

"We have tested our new Degree of Loading (DoL) cell design which can be directly transferred to the SRI mass flow calorimeter. We have shown that appropriately prepared Pd cathodes can reach high loadings in this new design and that the cells can be transferred to the calorimeter without degrading the cathode’s or cell’s performance. In all of the experiments the cathode deloaded at higher current densities, and ostensibly identical cathodes yield significantly different D:Pd loading/current density profiles. In the new cell design high purity Pd from IMRA Materials and Johnson Matthey have generally loaded better than recent lots of 99.9% Engelhard Pd. Pd that IMRA Materials cast in air with added CaB6 held its loading best at higher current densities. Electrolyte additives Al, Si, Nd and Sm had no perceptible effect on loading behavior. The regular addition of Cl- ion, similar to what might happen when topping up open cells, can increase or maintain loading. The presence of Cu is detrimental to good loading . . .",,,,,,

"Several groups have reported anomalous effects (heat and nuclear products) in thin PdDx materials stimulated by different forms of electro-diffusion. Using our cryogenic calorimeter we have measured the energy released from destructive electro-diffusion of a highly loaded PdH(D)x wires, co-deposited PdH(D)xon highly loaded PdH(D)x wires, and NiH(D)x wires. Generally, the D loaded metals yielded greater and more reliable excess energy than seen with the H loaded metals. The co-deposited PdDxon highly loaded PdDxwires yielded greater excess energy than the bulk wire hydrides or PdDxco-deposited on Ag wires as predicted by the calculations of Hagelstein and DeChiaro. The addition of a partial monolayer of a recombination poison yields a highly loaded PdDx cathode. Electro-stimulation of NiH(D)xwires have also shown excess energy, suggesting that renewed interest in this system may be justified.",,,,,,

"The absence of energetic nuclear particles in the Fleischmann–Pons experiment has been interpreted as indicating that a large nuclear quantum can be down-converted into a great many low energy vibrational quanta. Models that describe this also suggest that low energy vibrational quanta can be up-converted to produce nuclear excitation. Karabut’s collimated X-ray emission has been interpreted as being due to the up-conversion of vibrational energy in a small cathode to produce excitation in 201Hg. To test this, we developed a new experiment to vibrate a copper foil with and without surface Hg, and we looked for X-ray emission and charge emission from the surface. Signals were observed in the detectors in both cases; however, the signals in the X-ray detector did not respect the absorption edge of the Be window and are artifacts; and the large current signals associated with charge emission did not charge a capacitor in a simple configuration. We conclude that both are artifacts. The absence of collimated X-ray emission in this case is interpreted as due to the absence of strong low energy nuclear transitions in the copper, and also as ruling out a candidate theoretical model involving up-conversion due to interactions with negative energy transitions. A new interpretation of the Karabut experiment focuses now on lower frequency vibrations in the massive steel cathode holder and vacuum chamber as responsible for the up-conversion, and transfer of the up-converted energy to surface 201Hg to produce the collimated X-ray emission.",,,,,,

"The Controlled Electron Capture (CEC) method has been extended to use faster rise and fall time pulses, hydrogen isotope gas based systems at temperatures up to 650?C, and more precise and accurate calorimetry relative to results presented earlier. Our isoperibolic (IPB) cell/calorimeter is operated as an isothermal compensation type calorimeter. Potential sources of error in this system are discussed as well the methods used to minimize them. In power compensation mode the cell is held at a constant temperature using a heater power feedback system and constant power pulses or DC power steps are added to the system, resulting in a reduction of heater power. The relationship between this heater power reduction and DC power passed along the reactor core yields a calibration curve at different temperatures that allows us to evaluate how much output power increased during a given stimulation pulse. The IPB cell/calorimeter was stimulated by commanding different pulse widths at constant amplitude with the pulse power held constant by appropriately varying the pulse repetition rate. At 250–300?C the ratio of output power increase to input pulse power varied from 1.0 to over 2.0 depending on the pulse width at constant input power. That ratio was always 1.0 at all pulse widths attempted at 600?C. These results have been seen tens of times. The amount of excess power was also dependent on the composition of the gas and the metal alloy coatings on the core. The outer layer of the core was always pure Ni. The composition of a multilayer metal–dielectric metal coated core was chosen to allow for reasonable hydrogen solubility and mobility at 300?C. The results of various experiments are discussed Importantly these results presented here ignore the heater power necessary to maintain temperature and the losses in the pulse generator, which can be several times greater than either the stimulation power or power gain.",,,,,,

"Brillouin Energy and SRI International (SRI) have been performing calorimetry measurements on the Ni(Pd–Ni/ceramic/Cu(Ni) coated tubes in a H2 atmosphere with nanosecond pulses applied across the ceramic coating. We have been testing new materials, material fabrication techniques, and electrical stimulation methods to produce power and energy output in excess of that reported earlier. By applying fast pulses of several hundred volts and tens of nanoseconds long, the current follows the ""skin-effect"" principle and is concentrated at the Ni–ceramic interface but returns through the bulk of the Cu. Two stimulation methods were used – steady-state and dynamic. In the steady-state method, the pulse power is measured directly using fast oscilloscopes that record the voltage across the tube and a shunt resistor in series with the tube. The resistance of the shunt resistor is measured accurately under DC and pulse conditions. The input pulse power is determined by multiplying the calculated root-mean-square voltage and current and recorded every 10 s. Using a sophisticated model of the calorimeter with up to 15 coefficients, the power reaching the five temperature sensors is determined during simultaneous continuous ramps of both heater and pulse powers. The power emanating from the tube is determined during sequences of more frequent low voltage pulses (LVP) and compared to that found using less frequent high voltage pulses (HVP). The power determined during the more frequent LVP is set as the input power during that sequence. The power of the stimulation pulses during the less frequent HVP sequences is maintained equal to that during the more frequent LVP. Then the power calculated from the tube is divided by that calculated during the reference sequences, giving a so-called coefficient of performance (COP). We have shown an increase in both absolute LENR power produced and in COP.",,,,,,

"Brillouin Energy (BEC) has continued performing calorimetry measurements on the metal (e.g. Ni)/ceramic/Cu coated ceramic tube (catalyst) in a H2 atmosphere with nanosecond pulses applied across the coatings. The Energy Research Center (ERC) has been examining and verifying BEC’s calorimetry for over 18 months since 2 of the calorimeters have been moved from SRI International to BEC’s laboratory. We have continued our testing of new materials, material fabrication techniques, and electrical stimulation methods to produce excess power and energy output. By applying fast pulses of several hundred volts and tens of nanoseconds long, the current follows the ""skin-effect"" principle and is concentrated at the outer metal–ceramic interface but returns through the bulk of the Cu. Two stimulation methods were used – steady-state and dynamic. In the steady-state method, the pulse power is measured directly using fast oscilloscopes that record the voltage across the catalyst and a shunt resistor in series with the catalyst. The resistance of the shunt resistor is measured accurately under DC and pulse conditions. The input pulse power is determined by multiplying the calculated root-mean-square voltage and current and recorded every 10 s. Using a version of the system identification (SI) heat-flow model designed specifically for the BEC calorimeter, the power reaching the five temperature sensors is determined during simultaneous continuous ramps of both heater and pulse powers. The power emanating from the catalyst is determined during sequences of less frequent, longer duration, low voltage pulses (LVP) and compared to that found using more frequent, shorter duration, high voltage pulses (HVP). The power determined during the less frequent LVP is set as the input power during that sequence. The power of the stimulation pulses during the more frequent HVP sequences is maintained equal to that during the less frequent LVP. Then the calculated power output from the tube is divided by that calculated during the reference sequences, giving a so-called coefficient of performance (COP). We have also used mass flow calorimetry to determine COP. Low voltage, long pulses are chosen to match the input power from high voltage, short pulses. The low voltage pulses are not thought to stimulate LENR, while the high voltage pulses are. This provides a method to compare matching input power under conditions that stimulate LENR with conditions that do not. Any excess heat detected from the high voltage pulse condition is considered to be generated by LENR rather than resistive heating.",,,,,,

"We explore the results from the analyses of several low energy nuclear reactions (LENR)-active tubes run by Brillouin Energy (BEC) using several different techniques. The most novel analytical techniques are terahertz (THz) imaging and THz spectroscopy. This imaging technique gives insight into the lattice spacing of crystalline and micro-crystalline metals and ceramics complimentary to that from X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. XRD of powder removed from this sample showed the normal lattice spacing for pure Ni powder. However, THz imaging showed lattice dilation in the Ni coating. We discuss the potential source of this dilation as well as its possible importance to LENR. We will also discuss the results of THz spectroscopy performed on materials from this and similar tubes This report discusses metallurgical and physical measurements, such as optical microscopy, density and porosity measurements, terahertz (THz) imaging and spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). We also cover chemical and elemental measurements such as energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP- OES), ICP-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) and He mass spectroscopy. With the latter method we present an intriguing result that shows tritium production in a unique Pd electrolysis experiment. EDX, ICP-OES, and ICP-MS can help the researcher understand the role of minor and major elemental impurities in these materials. If present, ICP-MS may also detect isotopic anomalies in these materials post experiment. The ultimate point of this exercise should be to help the LENR field reproduce the materials that are best suited for use in LENR experiments such as that presented as a worked example of designing and manufacturing a Pd rod from measurements like these.",,,,,,

"""Super-absorption"" could occasionally appear when an H/Pd gas-loaded system was heated by an incandescent tungsten filament. The system-pressure was kept on in 10^-2 Pa for several hours without any aid of pumping. In this stage both ""excess heat"" and ""heat after death"" was observed once. By calibration, the feature constant of the system was 12.8ºC/W in maximum. When the ""excess heat"" appeared, the system temperature was reached 153ºC at the highest whereas the stable inputting power was 0.45mW. When the ""heat after death"" appeared—there was no power input to the system—the temperature of the system abruptly jumped up to 761ºC. In the former, 25kJ ""excess heat"" within 12 hours was measured which corresponded to 180 eV/atom Pd. And about 2MJ ""heat after death"" within 43 hours was corresponding to 13keV/atom Pd. The maximum excess powers in each case were 3.3 and 49W and the correlated power density were 230 and 3600 W/cm^3 Pd respectively. The variation results of concentration of Li-7and Li-6 and their abundance ratio in Pd suggested that the anomalous heat might come from a nuclear origin.",,,,,,

"A special experimental device was designed to test the anomalous thermal effect of Pd with deuterium flux (Df ) caused by deuteron diffusion passing through a thin wall of a Pd tube under a D2 pressure difference across the Pd wall. It is found that the variation of the flux was the significant precursor of the anomalous heat, because a remarkable heat flow was detected when the Df  was becoming obviously larger. The experiment was repeated for more than 16 times, and the maximum heat flow detected was 4.8mW whereas the accuracy of the calorimeter is better than 30μW. There were no heat flow detected when the temperature of the device was increased and when the D2 pressure difference equaled to zero. Neither heat flow nor flux was observed in the control experiment using N2.gas. The results of TLD (Themoluminescence dosimeter) detection implied a nuclear origin of the heat flow because the dosage of radiation in reaction vessel was often higher than that in reference vessel.",,,,,,

"A laser (λ=532 nm) operated in three modes (continuous, static pulsed and dynamic pulsed) was used to irradiate a series of palladium deuterides with different deuteron loading ratios in a D/Pd gas-loading system. (The loading ratios were D/Pd=0, 0.08, 0.10, 0.17 and 0.27.) The results showed that static pulsed triggering produces a maximum excess heat effect of about 2.6 kJ within a half hour when the loading ratio of Pd was about 0.1 and input power was 25 mW. This corresponds to 4.9 × 10^-15 J/atom D or 1.8 × 10^4 W/cm^3 Pd. The reason the static pulsed triggering produced more excess heat than other two modes needs to be further studied. The proper ratio in the Pd lattice matching a suitable triggering power may be a key point for heat production.",,,,,,

"In order to study the relationship between the triggering current, deuterium pressure and the excess heat, a series of experiments were made in a D/Pd gas-loading system. By comparing the system constants (k=?T/?P) in both nitrogen and deuterium atmosphere we found an optimum current (8A) and a deuterium pressure (9Ãƒ-104 Pa) in which the system could release a maximum excess power (more than 80W). The reproducibility was 16/16 and the excess energy released in the longest experiment was about 300MJ within 40 days, which was corresponding to 104 eV for each palladium atom. Analysis of the palladium surface with a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) revealed that some new surface topographical feature with concentrations of unexpected elements (such as Ag, Sn, Pb and Ca) appeared after the current triggering. The results implied that the excess heat might come from a nuclear transmutation.",,,,,,

"Abstract The effective interaction potential for charged particles is calculated in the deuterium plasma formed in the surface region of the palladium cathode in the electrolysis of heavy water. It is shown that the Coulomb potential is overscreened producing, at certain distances, an attractive potential between deuterium nuclei pairs and also between the deuterium nuclei and the surface atoms. This behavior of the effective potential in the deuterium plasma can be regarded as a counterpart of the Friedel oscillations of the electron gas at zero temperature. Because of this attractive potential, there are bound states for the deuteron pairs as well as for the surface atoms and deuterons. In these bound states the equilibrium distance between the nuclei is of the order 0.15 - 0.2 Å depending on the number density of deuterons. The fusion rate is calculated for the bounded deuteron pairs and it is found to be of the order per deuteron pair for the highest deuteron densities. Furthermore, it is shown that larger fusion rates are possible for the deuterons bound to the surface atoms. This may arise by a process, where the trapped deuterons share the released energy collectively via a proposed Multiple Resonance Scattering (MRS) mechanism. It is then found that the 4He-channel is the overwhelmingly dominant fusion channel. Moreover, the appearance of the transmutation processes in this MRS procedure are briefly discussed.",,,,,,

"Elemental analyses of palladium electrodes were conducted after a new type of light water electrolysis was performed at optimum conditions in a system designed to induce a nuclear reaction. This process is referred to as Pd/Pd light water critical electrolysis. The conjecture that a nuclear transmutation process is occurring in this experiment is easier to test in this system, because it is easy to determine whether the elements detected on the cathode surface are impurities or transmutation products. We assume that the elements found only on the cathode surface, and nowhere else in the cell as contamination, namely iron, titanium, chromium and so on, must be transmutation products. Furthermore, countless Ohmori-type palladium craters were observed for the first time for this system, and these are evidence that nuclear reactions occurred at the electrode surface.",,,,,,

"We have studied the Li+D and D+D fusion reactions in liquid Li by bombarding deuteron beams with energies below 70 keV. In the present work, an ultra sonic target system was developed to form acoustic cavitation bubbles in the liquid Li, in order to investigate the effect of the enhanced dynamic motion of the target. It was found that the ultra sonic effect strongly depends on a target condition and the D+D reaction could be enhanced very much due to the liquid Li cavitation. In addition, the D+D reaction rate is not constant but time dependent. Preliminary analyses indicate that decrease of the Coulomb energy barrier is about 2000 eV for a relatively stable condition. On the contrary, the Li+D reaction shows no meaningful effect for incident energies down to 30 keV. The present results indicate that not only density increase but also another mechanism enhancing reaction rates should be exist in liquid Li acoustic cavitation process.",,,,,,

"The strain and the electrical resistivity of a Pd sample stressed by a constant tension have been investigated through a series of hydrogenation cycles in a continuous H stoichiometry [0 <= x <= 0.8] range. The isotropic lattice expansion for both ""as drawn"" and ""annealed"" Pd sample reveals a strain of only 1% from pure Pd to PdH0.8 in disagreement with literature data available; the measured effect is minimum at x = 0.13 (á + â phase) and then from x = 0.6 (â phase) it has an exponential increase. The contribution of the mechanical tensile stress on the total relative elongation of the wire is also investigated. An increase of the Pd sample tensile strain after each hydrogenation cycle is reported for ""as drawn"" samples, while for ""annealed"" samples the reverse behaviour is observed. Moreover, annealed samples show considerably higher value of tensile strain compared to ""as drawn"". The variation of mechanical strain versus H content, for both ""annealed"" and ""as drawn"", has a maximum at x = 0.52. Strain variation and resistivity variation versus H content exhibit similar behaviour.",,,,,,

"A series of hydrogenation/dehydrogenation cycles have been performed on palladium wire samples, stressed by a constant mechanical tension, in order to investigate the changes in electrical and mechanical properties. A large increase of palladium electrical resistivity has been reported due to the combined effects of the production of defects linked to hydrogen insertion into the host lattice and the stress applied to the sample. An increase of the palladium sample strain due to hydrogenation/dehydrogenation cycles in alpha -> beta -> alpha phase transitions is observed compared to the sample subjected to mechanical tension only. The loss of initial metallurgical properties of the sample occurs already after the first hydrogen cycle, i.e. a displacement from the initial metallic behavior (increase of the resistivity and decrease of thermal coefficient of resistivity) to a worse one occurs already after the first hydrogen cycle. A linear correlation between palladium resistivity and strain, according to Matthiessen's rule, has been found.",,,,,,

"The Organizing Committee kindly suggested that I should talk about a state of cold fusion (CF) studies i n the Soviet Union. Offering of a special report dedicated to the soviet scientists works seems to be quite justified, since they are not well known to the western scientific community. Meanwhile, both quantitatively and qualitatively they bring a noticeable contribution to the world ""data bank"" on this interesting phenomenon. It is even possible that some of these soviet works have been ""precursors"" of the ""cold fusion era"". However, inadequate integration of our science with the western one, aggravated by scanty telecommunication media development, has slowed down the process of information exchange on CF not only with outer world, but also in our country . It is sufficient to say that the first Soviet National Conference on CF took place only recently in March of this year (March 22-26, Dubna-Moscow ). Figuratively speaking up to now we have been working behind the scenes and watching the play. Now it is time to raise the curtain.",,,,,,

"This article attempts to describe the processes occurring on the surface of palladium cathodes during their electrolytic electrolysis in electrolyte on the base of heavy water. The discussion is based on the experimental data on which were obtained in Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR) experiments lead for a number of years in Energetics Technology (Israel) (ET). The results of these experiments were presented in detail at the international conferences on cold fusion (ICCF). The main subject of these presentations was the description of experimental techniques and analysis of the results of calorimetric measurements, which in a number of cases indicated anomalous heat release, sometimes very significant, accompanying the process of electrochemical deuteration of Pd cathodes. However, the processes occurring in the cathode material, in particular, its structural transformations occurring during the absorption of deuterium by palladium, in these reports have appeared practically outside of discussion. This article partially fills this gap and, as the author believes, brings some clarity to the problem of searching for ``optimal'' palladium cathodes from the point of view of the probability of initiation of LENR.",,,,,,

It was based on theY.E.Kim’s work by using equivalent linear two-body (ELTB) method to the many-body problems of charged bosons trapped in an ion trap [2]. Recently, Kim et al. tried to explain the results of Rossi’s experiment [3] by using the ELTB method for a mixture of different two species of positive charged bosons trapped to the harmonic potential [4]. In this study, we verified Kim’s theory and considered how to perform the numerical calculation. A self-consistent iterative calculation was introduced and the coupled two equations corresponding to the two species of positive charged bosons were solved.",,,,,,

The application of this nuclear fusion method for nuclear waste transmutation, in particular caesium-137, is considered. On the basis of the calculations given conclusion about applicability of the method is made. According to the experimental data, saturation of titanium with deuterium-air mix results in temperature increase of the titanium deuteride sample by 45°C, in comparison with saturation of the same sample with pure deuterium. The calculation of excessive heat emission based on these results is given. The conditions necessary for the cold fusion reactions to occur are formulated.",,,,,,

"This paper discusses the mechanism of cold fusion with deuterium and other elements implanted in the potential sites of conductive crystals. Cold fusion in metals becomes possible due to the fact that the implantation of atoms in a crystal guides them to their p excitation levels, which are determined primarily by the positioning of free conduction electrons in a zone of potential sites. The excitation energy of the p-states is about 10–14 eV. The excited atoms’ orientation in the crystal is not random but dictated by the crystal lattice’s electrostatic potentials. Calculations show that the transparency of the Coulomb potential barrier, for example, in the case of DD-fusion, increases by about 60 orders of magnitude if two deuterium atoms meet each other in the minima of the conductor’s potentials in the crisscross orientation. Most of the papers are devoted to the process of DD-fusion in the electrolytic saturation by deuterium in crystals, a process that is extensively studied in these experiments.

For the Pd samples annealed or cold worked, the excess counts higher than BG (background levels = 32 ± 2 cpm) by factors 1.5 to 2 in average were measured almost continuously and reproducibly during the pulses modulated electrolysis over 600 mA/cm^2. The excess counts were measured for a wild even after electrolysis. For the Ti samples annealed or cold worked, the burst-like GM counts over 200 cpm were often measured at low current densities below 10 mA/cm^2. The much higher burst-like GM counts over 1500 cpm were measured after electrolysis.",,,,,,

"Activation is carried out by heating a Pd specimen at about 600 °C for several minutes in air. The activated surface is blue, and it is bleached when immersed hi hydrogen gas. The blue film is identified as PdO, and the bleached surface consists of nanocrystallites of metallic Pd, as proved by electron diffraction. An activated Pd plate 0.7 mm in thickness is capable of absorbing, in 1 h, about 70 at% of H or D, the saturation value, in hydrogen gas of 1 atm at room temperature. The atomic ratio of H absorbed in Pd has been estimated to be about 70% when Pd metal is in equilibrium with hydrogen gas of 1 atm at 25°C. . . .",,,,,,

"Based on theoretical calculations, new schemes to increase deuterium density in palladium over its initial value is presented. High deuterium concentration in palladium is needed for application to the solid-state fusion. The first deuterium enrichment scheme makes use of the plasma ion implantation, which consists of a cylindrical palladium rod (target) preloaded with deuterium atoms, coated with diffusion-barrier material and immersed in a deuterium plasma. The second deuterium enrichment scheme makes use of the temperature gradient effects on the deuterium solubility in palladium. A heat source at temperature T2 and a heat sink at temperature T1 (where T2 > T1 ) are in contact with two different parts of a palladium sample, which has been presoaked with deuterium atoms and has been coated with diffusion-barrier material or securely locked in a metal case.",,,,,,

Following attempts to reproduce the claimed results, the Martin Fleischmann Memorial Projecty (MFMP) is adding significant insights to the replication community across the Internet. The first part of the paper describes the replication of the Lugano Report’s thermal measurements. It presents the experimental setup, instrumentations as well as the results produced by the MFMP team. The second part describes attempts to reproduce the excess energy claimed in the Report. After ten experiments and five incremental revisions of the apparatus, MFMP published results on the Internet showing apparent correlation between anomalous heat production and broadband low energy gamma radiation. This paper offers a review of these two significant experiments, done in March 2015 and January 2016.",,,,,,

"By ""Bremsstrahlung"" is meant the continuous quantum radiation arising when electrons undergo braking in the fields of atomic nuclei. Discovered by Rontgen as long ago as 1895, this type of radiation occurs when the beta-electrons from a disintegrating beta-emitter are braked in the surrounding matter, being termed ""external bremsstrahlung"" in this case. But in such isotopes the beta-electron is also accompanied by a type of radiation that is independent of the surrounding matter. This type is called ""internal bremsstrahlung"", because it is generated by the electron inside the radioactive atom, during the decay process. It was first demonstrated by Aston 1) in the ""twenties"" when, in the course of gamma-ray measurements on RaE, he detected a soft, inhomogeneous form of gamma-radiation.",,,,,,

"Silicate solubilising bacteria were isolated from soil, river water, pond sediment and talc mineral. The isolates were characterised and found to belong to the genera Bacillus and Pseudomonas sp. Some of the isolates are also identified by 16S r RNA sequencing. Both Bacillus and Pseudomonas isolates solubilised magnesium trisilicate under in vitro conditions either in the presence or in the absence of glucose. Bacillus megaterium isolated from soil solubilised talc, feldspar and magnesium trisilicate by releasing silica in solution. This also exhibited growth exclusively on silicate in the absence of a carbon source and after removal CO2 in the head space of the flask containing medium. Bacillus mucilaginosus, a silicate solubilising species, exhibited growth on acid washed sand (pure quartz) and also in silicic acid in the absence of carbon source revealing the capability of the bacteria to utilise silica or silicate for its growth. The carbon analysis by SEM with EDAX revealed the presence of carbon in cells grown exclusively on silica suggesting the biological transmutation of silica to carbon. The ability of silicate solubilising bacteria to grow exclusively on silica or silicate in the absence of carbon reveals not only their ecological survival in a carbon-free environment in earth but also their likely survival in other celestial bodies.",,,,,,

"The problem of converting the heat produced by cold fusion into work, meets with a classical limit consisting in the second principle of thermodynamics, because the heat produced within electrolytic cells is released to the heavy water, and remains at a low thermal degree. However, this paper draws attention to the existence of ideal thermodynamic cycles the efficiency of which is considerably higher than the efficiency attained by the corresponding Carnot cycle between the same temperatures. In addition to this, it can be shown that combinations of these cycles can attain even higher efficiencies. Owing to the characteristics of these cycles and combinations of cycles, and being also possible to put them into practice, they could be taken into consideration for projects aiming at the transformation into work of the heat produced by cold fusion or other heat sources at low temperature.",,,,,,

"In this paper is studied the behaviour of ions confined by means of quadrupolar electro-dynamic containment around palladium lattice tetrahedral sites. Ion confinement in a quadrupolar trap is known to be strongly influenced by the initial conditions and trap parameters. The considered system is a lattice ion trap for deuterons, supposing that over a certain concentration they occupy the tetrahedral sites. The electron motions seem to have a dominant role in the dynamics of two deuterons moving around such lattice sites. A mathematical model allows us to describe, with a computer simulation, the deuteron dynamics and reveals an approach mechanism that could strongly decrease the mean distance between two positive charges embedded in a lattice.",,,,,,

"The electrodynamic confinement of charged particles stored in a radio-frequency electric quadrupole trap has been widely investigated by several authors [1,2]. A remarkable similarity between the above mentioned quadrupole radio-frequency trap and the palladium lattice structure allowed a classical study of the dynamics of two deuterons moving within the Pd lattice around tetrahedral sites [3,4]. The theory of the harmonic oscillator with time dependent frequency has been reviewed by introducing an operator which is a constant of the motion [5]. In this paper a quantum description of a deuteron dynamics and its interaction with an other one inside the lattice ion trap is carried out taking advantage of an oscillating behaviour that can be traced back to a quantum harmonic oscillator. The calculations show, in both treatments, a reduction of the mean distance between the particles.",,,,,,

"A considerable research activity has been carried out in the last years in order to better investigate the field of nuclear reactions in solids. Results concerning the reproducibility of the phenomena, theoretical studies and certain unknown nuclear effects in metal-hydrogen systems have been published by several authors. It has been shown that positive ions (i.e. deuterons) confined by means of a quadrupolar electro-dynamic containment around palladium lattice tetrahedral sites (lattice ion trap) can dramatically decrease their mean distance. In the proposed picture the coherent oscillations of the Fermi level electrons of the metal atoms seem to have a dominant role in the deuterons dynamics.",,,,,,

"In this work the dynamics of the particles is studied in the trap coordinate system, rather than in the particles relative ones, since in this way it is possible to follow the position of a moving particle (e.g. deuteron or proton) inside the metal lattice cell.

"A nickel-hydride thin film was studied by the Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR) method. The differences between a ""black"" film and a pure nickel film ""blank"" behaviour are showed. The black Ni-hydride film has been obtained by a short electrolysis with 1 M Li2SO4 electrolyte in light water. A shift in the minimum of the observed reflected light occurs, together with a change in the minimum shape, i.e. its half-height width increases. This two phenomenon are due to the change in the electronic band structure of the metal induced by the electron added in the lattice by hydrogen. The changing of the electronic structure, revealed by the laser coupling conditions, leads to consider that an hydride phase was created. Both the blank (not hydrogenated) and black (hydrogenated) specimens were taken under He-Ne laser beam at the reflectance minimum angle for about three hours. A SIMS analysis was also implemented to reveal differences in the isotopic composition of Cu, as marker element, between the blank and black films, in order to study the coupled effect of electrolysis and plasmon-polariton excitation on LENR processes in condensed matter.",,,,,,

"A recent joint work [1] identified the crucial role of material science in improving control of the Pd-D system to enhance the production of excess power during electrochemical loading of palladium foils with deuterium. Very high reproducibility, close to 100%, in loading Pd up to D/Pd ~1 (atomic fraction) was achieved. High loading about the threshold value of 0.9 is considered necessary to achieve the effect. This work demonstrated it is necessary but not sufficient. As a consequence, the focus of our research moved to the material properties of cathodes, especially surface characteristics, and an effort to correlate these properties with cathode performance during electrolysis. This paper describes the material properties examined that appear to produce excess heat.",,,,,,

"The state of the palladium metal has been identified on the basis of statistical data to play fundamental roles in producing the Fleischman-Pons excess heat effect. The deuterium loading dynamics and its equilibrium concentration are mostly controlled by the metallurgy; a minimum threshold loading (D/Pd ~ 0.9) is necessary to observe the excess. The crystallographic orientation is also correlated with the phenomenon such that mainly 100 oriented samples gave the highest reproducibility. A specific cathode surface morphology, identified by means of the power spectral density function, represents an additional identified condition to observe the effect. Materials specimens respecting the characteristics described above have been used to obtain a transportable reproducibility. Designed materials giving excess power have been produced but the amplitude of the signals and full reproducibility are not yet achieved. Other features of the material such as the nature and content of impurities and defects seems to be crucial in obtaining the required palladium characteristics.",,,,,,

"The production of excess power during electrochemical loading of palladium with deuterium was discovered in 1989 by Prof Martin Fleischmann and Prof Stanley Pons. In this article a picture of the research activities performed to correlate the effect and the material status is given. The structures of the electrochemical interface during the excess event and in the absence of excess power are compared, revealing a resonant equivalent circuit when the electrode is active.

Abstract,,,,,,
"The study of the Fleischmann–Pons Effect (FPE), i.e. the production of excess power production during electrochemical loading of deuterium in palladium (in the past labeled cold fusion) has had a notably multidisciplinary character, involving solid state and nuclear physics, material science, electrochemistry and other fields. Correlations between the material status and the occurrence of the effect as well as some changes in the electrochemical interface status have been observed. Although during the last two decades, in several calorimetric experiments the effect was observed to be well above the measurement uncertainty, the mechanism producing the excess power is not completely understood. So far, the lack of reproducibility has been responsible for the absence of a clear explanation of the phenomenon based on experimental apparatus designed to enhance the spectrum of information required to define the effect. Recently, In order to improve this aspect of this research, specific work has been carried out to investigate whether the excess power was produced concurrently with the emission of Radio Frequency from the active cathode. Suitable probes and triggering included in the RF experimental system revealed RF signal emission during electrochemical loading of palladium samples, and a correlation between the heat production, in active samples, and RF signal emission was found. The preliminary results highlight the importance of performing studies on the electrodynamic effects that may be involved in the phenomenon, and the importance of the design of appropriate instruments designed to investigate unexplored regions of metal hydrogen systems.",,,,,,

The paper discusses the process of controlling the probability of spontaneous decay of radioactive and excited Mossbauer nuclei. For the first time two experiments have proved the possibility of changing the life time of radioactive nuclei by surrounding them with screens having resonant absorption frequency equal to the nuclear transition frequency. For the first time in the experiments with gamma sources C057(Fe57*) and Sn119m and with gamma absorbers Fe57 and Sn119 we have discovered the change of Mossbauer transition life-time by 20-100% and total life-time (including non- Mossbauer radiation and electron conversion) by 0.6-2%.,,,,,,

This paper paper discusses the theory and results of a direct experimental investigation into the control of internal electron conversion channels of radioactive isotopes' spontaneous decay. This occurs by controlling the action of an oriented crystal matrix on the motion of conversion electrons. The same effect takes place at any beta-processes (including at decay of a neutron with an emission of electrons and neutrino). It was shown that parameters of internal electron conversion decay greatly depended on the structure of the crystal matrix and on the distance between the excited nucleus and the crystal matrix.,,,,,,

It is shown that transmutation during the process of growth of microbiological cultures, at optimal conditions in microbiological associations, is 20 times more effective than the same transmutation process in the form of ""One-line"" (clean) microbiological cultures. In the work, the process of direct, controlled decontamination of highly active intermediate lifetime and long-lived reactor isotopes through the process of growing microbiological associations has been studied. For the first time, an accelerated deactivation rate is observed that is 35 times larger than the controlled deactivation of the Cs137 isotope.

We have determined the form of such an optimum dependence of the correlation coefficient on time, at which the formation of a maximally correlated states of particles and the attainment of the maximum variance of their coordinates under a parametric pumping of a harmonic oscillator are possible. The conditions allowing the choice of those possible laws of variations of the frequency of a harmonic oscillator, which cause the formation of a correlated state, are established. The possible type of a parametric pumping which induces the fast asymptotic formation of the completely correlated state of a particle with giant increasing variance of the coordinate under the parabolic barrier and similar increasing of nuclear reactions probability are determined.",,,,,,

In the report the universal mechanism of optimization of low energy nuclear reactions on the basis of coherent correlated states of interacting particles at different kinds of nonstationary periodical action to the system is considered. We have considered the peculiarities and investigated the efficiency of the creation of a correlated state under a periodic action on a harmonic oscillator. This method is shown to lead to rapid formation of a strongly correlated particle state that provides an almost complete clearing of the potential barrier even for a narrow range of oscillator frequency variations. Several successful low energy fusion experiments based on usage of correlated states of interacting particles are discussed.,,,,,,

"The prehistory, present state and prospects of transmutation of stable and radioactive isotopes in growing biological objects are considered. The biological and physical causes of this phenomenon are briefly considered. It is shown that the most likely physical mechanism for the production of nuclear reactions in biological systems is the process of formation of coherent correlated states of interacting particles. This process is accompanied by giant energy fluctuations, which can exist for a long time, sufficient to produce nuclear reactions. This process happens automatically in non-stationary potential wells, which are formed during cell division, DNA replication, at the entrance to plasma ion channels and in other places of growing objects.",,,,,,

The amplitude of these fluctuations exceeds by many orders the average thermal energy of the particles and can reach 10–50 keV and more.

These waves are formed on the reverse side of the metal target, which is affected by the jet of water in a state of cavitation, and are characterized by strictly defined frequencies (in air under normal conditions and different humidity, the minimum frequency of such a wave is equal to MHz) [1–7] Such waves can propagate in air for a long distance (in the laboratory - more than 2 meters and this distance was limited only by the size of our laboratory).

"A ""macro view"" of the cold fusion process in a Deuterium-Palladium System is presented which embraces the idea that there is both an enabling process and a heat-producing process. The enabling process is non-nuclear and is one of controlling the Deuterium (D) chemical potential. After surpassing a high threshold D chemical potential, some of the true deuterium reactants, Dx's, are able to form. The formation of the new Dx's involves a change of state of the D's which reduces their repulsion forces and increases the probability of spontaneous fusion events. Once some of the Dx's are in place, there, indeed, is coupling between the non-nuclear and nuclear processes as shown by the experimental measurement of the heat produced.",,,,,,

"ABSTRACT ""Genie"", a 40 KHZ sonofusion reactor consists of 2 opposing 40 KHz piezos separated by 4 mm of D2O, with a centered Ti target foil, with one piezo transmitting, the other receiving and taking that signal, amplifying it, then feeding it back to the transmitter as the resonating frequency of the reactor. This process makes for efficient watt input, Qi, where 80% of these watts will be used as the acoustic input, Qa, to the ""Genie"" sonofusion reactor. In the reactor the transient cavitation bubbles, TCBs, produce billions of low energy high density jets per second that accelerate deuterons into foil targets producing excess heat, Qx. The Qx is determined by calorimetric measurements of experiments that use coolant water circulated to the surface of the well insulated reactor and data collected in the form of T in and T out at steadystate temperatures and coolant flow rate. The total watts out, Qo, minus Qa ideally should equal zero, and we know that this calorimetry method has several losses that are not measured. This makes the method very conservative when looking for Qx. The Qx must make up those heat losses before making its presence known. The result from experiments of system I using flow x DT x 4.184 for Qo - Qi = Qx shows that Qx values over unity are the norm. System II used a more realistic calculation for Qx where flow x DT x 4.184 for Qo - Qa = Qx showed increased results. The calibration of the reactor with a Joule heater, JH, and substituting H2O for D2O produced measurements that showed the reactor calorimetry was close to zero Qx production as one would expect. These measurements showed that heat in = heat out, a good zero indicating no Qx, for the operation of the ""Genie"" sonofusion reactor.",,,,,,

"Combining advances in understanding the strong force with experiments on lattice fusion allows a description of lattice D–D fusion to be constructed. What has to be exposed is a nuclear energy loss mechanism leaving little or no residual radioactivity. The requirements on the lattice for D–D fusion are strict and appear to be limited to particular FCC lattices within a range of lattice parameters. A mechanical understanding is needed of how elevated local concentrations of deuterium are achieved while avoiding being trapped at defect sites. Using optical, RF, and experimental anomalous heat data the metallurgical requirements for the process is refined by considering a combination of diffusion, partial molar volume, positron annihilation data, defect kinetics, and electronic band structure allowing logical exhaustion to identify the kinetic structure that drives lattice nuclear fusion.",,,,,,

During static charging, the Pd electrode was removed from the cell and partially outgassed in air. Resumpt ion of the charging produced several repeated heat bursts. In the dynamic test, cyclic torsion was applied to the Pd electrode during the charging .

"Since observation of ""cold fusion"" was claimed in 1 989, a great number of experiments have been done for verifying these claims. Most of laboratories were not able to reproduce the observations and among the results of experiments there are obvious inconsistencies. It has been realized that even if the ""cold fusion"" happened, its signals would be quite weak. Thus for sake of confirming the presence of ""cold fusion"", it is desirable to use detection techniques which have high collecting power, low background and can stably work for long time. CR-39 plastic track detector is able to work in passive and time-integrated modes and has a number of unique merits in comparison with electronic detectors. In gas-loading experiment, if a piece of CR -39 film is clamped on the surface of a metal foil of Pd or Ti, charged particles emitted by deuterated metal can be collected by the CR-39 foil with 2 pi solid angle. The information on charge, energy, location and direction of the emitted particles can be determined from track parameters. . . .",,,,,,

Electrons could rotate around the axis connecting two nuclei in some orbits. In the process to form a quasi-atom, some energy may be emitted. There may be double hydrogen nuclei and metal-hydrogen double nuclei, two types of quasi-atoms in metal-hydrogen systems.

"The deuterium cluster ion beam (D3+) and deuteron beam (D+), which energy was adjusted from 10 keV to 100 keV per deuteron, were alternately implanted into palladium target, in order to study the atomic and nuclear cluster effect in the interaction between cluster ion and solid. The differences between the application of these two kind beams were obtained by comparing the radiation yields of X-ray, gamma-ray, charged particle and neutron induced by each deuteron of two kinds of beam at the same velocity. The fusion rate induced by each cluster-deuteron in the energy region below 40 keV/d was higher than that induced by each isolated deuteron at the same velocity. However the fusion rate induced by each cluster-deuteron was less in the energy region above 50 keV/d. Ratio of the fusion rate induced by each cluster deuteron to that induced by each isolated deuteron was energy dependent. The yield of X-ray induced by each cluster deuteron in the energy region from 10 keV/d to 100 keV/d was higher than that induced by each isolated deuteron at the same velocity. The average ratio of their X-ray yields is about 2.6. Based on above results, it is considered there might be an enhancement of interaction cross-section in both nuclear and atomic levels in lower energy region. If the size of cluster ion is grown, the enhancement might be increased more. Therefore, the concentrated deuterons (deuterium in larger clusterstate) could have some relations with ""cold fusion "" phenomena in high loading metal.",,,,,,

"A broad unknown peak, which appeared between triton peak (lMe V) and proton peak (3MeJl) 0/ D-D reactions, was /requently observed in our deuterium ion beam implantation experiments with large current on metal targets (e.g. Pd). The peak could be seen in almost every run of experiment. The counts of this peak kept almost constant ratio (about 0. 07) with the D-D proton peak that took place within the deuteron implanting ·range. Therefore, this unknown peak was considered as charged particle from unknown reaction (e.g. proton/rom D-D fusion) that occurred deeply (beyond the deuteron range) inside the palladium target plate. The reaction should be induced by some other trigger conditions except the direct beam-target effect of deuteron implantation. Similar phenomena were also observed, while the Ti. Fe, Ni. Cu and Mo foils (plates) were applied as targets, but the depth profiles of the reaction zones were quite different for different targets. Temperature of target has made some influence on reaction place. Both of cluster ion (D3+) and isolated deuteron (D+) beams were applied to the experiment. The results have shown that each isolated deuteron could induce higher rate of unknown reaction, compared with each deuteron of cluster ion beam. The experimental results show that the unknown reaction had some kind of dependence on ion states, target materials, temperature, deuterium loading ratio, etc. conditions. These factors are similar to the usually considered key factors in other type cold fusion experiments. There might be some relations between this unknown reaction and Cold Fusion phenomena, but further identification is necessary to find the origin of the peak and the relation with CF phenomena.",,,,,,

"Low energy (1-300 keV) deuterium ion beam implantation experiment on Palladium and titanium foil (plate) were preformed, in order to study the nuclear and atomic interaction in solid. X-ray, gamma ray, charged particle and neutron ware measured simultaneously. A series of anomalous experimental phenomena ware observed. A clear peak at 3.2 MeV was observed, when a pre-loading TiDx was applied. This peak became evidently, following the implantation dose. Therefore, it is considered as the alpha peak from D-T secondary reaction. Its maximum ratio to D-D reaction reached 0. 0015. This ratio was much higher than prediction value based on the secondary reaction of D-D fusion. Some unknown high energy counts located from 3.5 MeV to 17 MeV in charged particle spectra has been observed for many times. Sometimes the counts concentrated in limited area, which appeared like a peak but poor statistics. The phenomena were difficult to be reproduced. In the X-ray spectra, there were many characteristic peaks from Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Zr, Ru, Pd etc elements. The gamma radiation up to 30 MeV was measured with a HpGe detector. Comparing to background, the intensity of foreground was a few orders higher. There was also a few counts distributed around 17 MeV and 24 MeV, which might be the gamma ray from D(d, gamm)4He reactions.",,,,,,

This is about twice the excess obtained in co-deposition experiments. The excess thermal power output ranged from 0.5 ± 0.1 W to 2.6 ± 0.1 W, which was an average of about 17 % more than the input power.

It is confirmed that they are neither the characteristic X-ray of C, O or other possible impurity element, nor diffractive spectral lines, nor the ¡°absorption cut off¡±of electron bremsstrahlung spectrum. It is most likely that they are a kind of X-ray spectral series of new kind of atom state. A new theory model called small hydrogen atom was put forward to explain the spectrum.

"Abstract: Using Ti-Pt electrodes in closed electrolytic cells containing D2O-H2SO4 electrolyte, evidence for excess thermal power generation has been observed (i.e. Power out - Power in > 0). It had been noted that experiments (8-cell) with smaller cathodes (larger perimeter to area ratio) performed better than experiments (SEC system) in which larger cathodes (smaller perimeter to area ratio) were used. In an effort to increase the magnitude of the excess power output, slits were introduced into the larger cathodes to increase the perimeter to area ratio. Two SEC systems were used during the course of these experiments. Using data from the first SEC system we find that four of seven (57%) of the experiments with slit cathodes showed an excess thermal power, averaging 322 mW (ranging from 136 to 509 mW) and five of fourteen (36%) of the experiments with no cathode slits gave excess thermal power, averaging 171 mW (ranging from 115 to 233 mW). Overall, 10 of 13 (77%) of the experiments with slit cathodes showed excess power while only 5 of 15 (30%) of the experiments with no slits in the cathodes showed excess power. This result shows an increase in both the magnitude and reproducibility of the excess power output effect. In addition, Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) was performed on several cathodes (post-experiment) where greater concentrations of unexpected elements are found in those cells that showed excess power compared to those cells that did not show excess power.",,,,,,

"This work discusses the ongoing development of diamond-based radiation sensors for spectrometry within the environments found in low energy nuclear reaction (LENR) experiments. Specifically discussed are the efforts to demonstrate the robustness of palladium-electrode sensors. This includes fabrication methods, characterization and calibration techniques, and the results of deuterium gas loading trials which demonstrate performance throughout the entire test. The results are positive. One notable peak in the spectrometry results; additional trials are required to both determine the cause of this peak and determine which criteria.",,,,,,

"This paper discusses recent attempts to reproduce thermal shock experiments from 1991 using additional diagnostics. This was motivated by an apparent series of neutron bursts which were observed during the deuterium loading of titanium powder at cryogenic temperatures. The neutron count rate and temperature measurements are presented for control and experimental trials. Some neutrons were observed during trials, but the magnitude of the burst which motivated this work could not be replicated. Control trials with inert gas, which should produce no reaction, also demonstrated neutron signal. Future experimental directions are also discussed.",,,,,,

"This report serves as the final written documentation for the Aeronautic Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) Seedling Fund’s Low Energy Nuclear Reaction (LENR) Aircraft Phase I project. The findings presented include propulsion system concepts, synergistic missions, and aircraft concepts. LENR is a form of nuclear energy that potentially has over 4,000 times the energy density of chemical energy sources. It is not expected to have any harmful emissions or radiation which makes it extremely appealing. There is a lot of interest in LENR, but there are no proven theories. This report does not explore the feasibility of LENR. Instead, it assumes that a working system is available. A design space exploration shows that LENR can enable long range and high speed missions. Six propulsion concepts, six missions, and four aircraft concepts are presented. This report also includes discussion of several issues and concerns that were uncovered during the study and potential research areas to infuse LENR aircraft into NASA’s aeronautics research.",,,,,,

"The internal and external bremsstrahlung of tritium have been investigated by a new method, using titanium-tritium films. A great discrepancy was found between the experimental results and the theory. The experimental values of the ratio I-EBS were between four and thirty times lower than the ratio I-IBS predicted by theory. This discrepancy may be due either to the generation of characteristic x-radiation in the experimental arrangement used or to the fact that the theory is not applicable to tritium on account of its extremely low atomic number and beta-ray energy. The wide scatter in the experimental results may likewise be due to the generation of characteristic x-radiation.",,,,,,

"Highlights are presented of recent results obtained on deuterium and hydrogen loading of palladium both in electrolytes and in the gas phase. Reproducible tritium generation has been found on palladium cathodes with deuterium loadings approaching one deuterium atom per palladium atom. Tritium generation has been observed on four out of four such highly loaded cathodes. No tritium has been observed in four light water control cells operating simultaneously. Total tritium analysis was performed on all hermetically sealed cells before and after each experiment. Tentative evidence is presented for neutron generation and a single anomalous heat excursion. A novel high-pressure electrochemical cell is also described which employs a fuel cell approach, thereby avoiding oxygen evolution. Two anomalous heat excursions have been observed in this cell with excess power values up to 30%. Gas phase experiments of the Wada-type have been performed on palladium, using electrical discharges to activate the palladium. Neutron bursts up to 280 neutrons in 128 microseconds and tritium enhancements in the palladium of up to 25X background have been observed in the palladium. In both electrolytic and gas phase experiments, the tritium distribution in the palladium wires was found to be non-uniform.",,,,,,

"Tritium up to fifty times background has been observed upon electrolyzing 1N D2 SO4 in four out of four cells when using Pd cathodes ""of a certain type"". No tritium was detected in four control cells, containing H2S04 in H2O, employing Pd cathodes cut from the same wire spool. Tritium amounts were from 7 x 10^10 to 2.1 × 10^11 atoms, corresponding to average generation rates from 5.1 × 10^4 to 2 × 10^5 atoms/sec/cm^2. In all cases, D/Pd and H/Pd loadings of 1 ± 0.05 were attained. A cyclic loading/unloading regime rather than the usual continuous constant current regime was applied to attain these high loadings. Tritium analysis was performed in Pd, electrolyte and the gas head space of the sealed cells. Maximum tritium concentrations of 8.9 × 10^10 atoms/g Pd, 180 times the detection limit, were found in the D-loaded Pd cathodes, none in the Η-loaded Pd, Also, no tritium within detection limit was found in 150 unused Pd pieces. Of these, 13 were cut randomly from the same wire spool as the four D-loaded Pd cathodes. The probability that the tritium in the latter was due to random spot contamination is computed as 1 in 2,380. It is concluded that the tritium was generated by nuclear reactions in the Pd. However, no tritium was detected in four D-loaded Pd cathodes of a different type in spite of attaining loadings D/Pd = 1. Different metallurgical history and impurity contents may play an important role.",,,,,,

"Reproducible tritium generation well above background has been observed in tightly closed D2SO4-containing cells in four out of four Pd wire cathodes of one type. Tritium analysis was performed before and after each experiment on the Pd, the electrolyte and the gas in the head space. No tritium generation was observed in four identical Pd cathodes in H2SO4 cells operated at the same time under the same conditions. A cyclic loading-unloading regime with low current densities, rather than the usual continuous constant current regime, was employed to attain D/Pd and H/Pd loadings of 1 ± 0.05 reproducibly. D/Pd loadings greater than 0.8 ±0.05 appear to be necessary to generate tritium. The largest amount of tritium, generated in 7 days of continuous electrolysis, was 2.1 x 10E11 tritium atoms, compared with a background of 4 x 10E9 tritium atoms. The concentration of tritium and its axial distribution in the Pd were determined and concentrations of up to 9 x 10E10 atoms/g Pd were found compared with a maximum background of 5 x 10E8 atoms g-1. The T/D ratio in the Pd is about 100 times larger than in the electrolyte or gas and indicates that tritium generation occurs in the Pd interior rather than at its surface. No tritium generation was observed in two other types of Pd electrodes in D2SO4, despite the attainment of D/Pd ratios near 1:1. Thus high D/Pd ratios appear to be a necessary but not sufficient condition for tritium generation in D2SO4 electrolysis.",,,,,,

"This paper presents a model to determine the optimum power source for a manned spacecraft to Mars; that is to say, the most economical and reliable power source. Low energy nuclear reactions (LENR) is evaluated for application to several areas including space travel, in which the vacuum of space cannot provide any propellant or other materials. It is assumed that LENR may become a practical source of useable energy. Several things must be considered for a successful journey from Earth to Mars, including the trip rout, the type of rocket, energy source, and the spacecraft speed. These are discussed for space travel using LENR. The velocity of the rocket increases as the mass flow rate decreases. The shortest route of a trip to Mars is selected to reduce cost.",,,,,,

The controlled out-diffusion method was employed to induce a nuclear reaction in a palladium (Pd) plate with a MnOx film. The time-resolved mass spectra for Pd deuteride revealed tritium (T) production during the out-diffusion experiment. Similar time behaviors of mass number 1-4 and 6 in the spectra was also observed for Pd hydride. Film blackening was observed for most Pd deuteride as well as Pd hydrides using a normal monochromatic negative photographic film. The radiation from the Pd plate consists of two kinds of components for a Pd hydride. Secondary ion mass spectroscopy has shown considerable increase in counts of Li for Pd hydride after the out-diffusion experiment.,,,,,,

Electrolysis of H2O solution is carried out using a Ni film cathode under the DC condition. The scintillator of ZnS(Ag) is positioned in close contact with the rear surface of the thin Ni film cathode to observe the visible scintillation and to recognize the energetic charged particle emission from the Ni film cathode. Using the simple technique, visible scintillation is identified during the electrolysis. The scintillation appears in a very short moment with the color of blue-white. The considerably high count rate of the flash from the scintillator in the electrolysis experiment is obtained comparing with the rate in the control experiment.",,,,,,

"Using our own ""in vacuo"" method with a heterostructure of deuterated Pd (Pd:D), we have succeeded in the first highly reproducible and ""in situ"" detection of 4He production. The real time observation has been performed by high-resolution quadrupole mass spectroscopy (0.001 amu at 4 amu). The amount of 4He gas produced was closely correlated with the evolution of excess heat, and it increased with the loading ratio of D to Pd. At the highest loading ratio of D to Pd, we have also observed T production by detecting HT. The amount of HT increased in the final stages of 4He production. The system of H-loaded Pd (Pd:H) heterostructure, on the other hand, produced neither 4He nor T. Furthermore, the energy spectrum of charged particles detected during these experiments has revealed that a particles with an energy of 4.5-6 Me V and protons with an energy of 3 Me V were emitted from the oxide surface of Pd. The amount, however, was extremely small in comparison with that of 4He detected. These results indicate that a new class of nuclear fusion occurs in the Pd:D and Pd:H systems.",,,,,,

The excess power generation correlated to the sample distortion was observed with 100 % reproducibility. The peak excess power was estimated as much as 8 W with the input being 0.1 W. The total amount of excess power was at most 39 kJ, indicating that the energy generated was of the order of 1 eV per D (H) atom. Nevertheless, None of the nuclear products was detected clearly. This result suggests that the highly reproducible excess power observed in the present experiment is correlated to the structural phase transition at the Pd surface. We discuss the origin of the anomalous heat generation within the condensed matter physics.",,,,,,

The fractofusion mechanism of Cold Fusion is investigated theoretically. The conditions necessary for fractofusion are clarified. The origin and quantity of the electrical field inside cracks in the conductor are clarified also. The characteristics of Cold Fusion are explained by the mechanism. Almost all the total neutron yields experimentally observed are smaller than the upper limit predicted by the fractofusion mechanism. It indicates that they can be explained by the fractofusion mechanism.,,,,,,

Tritium searches in deuterium gas phase of several different systems were done by this detector.

"Yields of protons emitted in the D + D reaction in Pd, Au/Pd/PdO, Ti, and Au foils are measured by a dE-E counter telescope for bombarding energies between 2.5 and 10 keV. The experimental yields are compared with those predicted from a parametrization of the cross section and stopping power at higher energies. It is found that for Ti and Au target the enhancement of the D(d,p)T reaction is similar to that observed with a deuterium gas target (several tens of eV). The dependence of the yields on the bombarding energy corresponds well to the screening potential parameters Ux=250±15 eV for Pd and 601±23 eV for Au/Pd/PdO.

"While widely acknowledged as the father of the Hydrogen Economy and worthy to be dubbed as grandfather of the Methanol Economy, John O’Mara Bockris (JOMB) continued to inspire important environmental advances to the end of his most creative life. His co-invention of what may turn out to be a ground-breaking US Patent 8,413,420 helps to open the way to capturing CO2 from automotive exhausts and its conversion to recyclable methanol fuel, thereby greatly reducing and possibly even reversing global warming. Most recently, in a letter dated shortly before his death, published herein as the Appendix, JOMB pointed to inexpensive mass production of methanol from natural gas via the syngas route which may lead to the displacement of gasoline by methanol as the main automotive fuel and to major reductions in global CO2 emissions.",,,,,,

"A method for producing heavy electrons is based on a material system that includes an electrically-conductive material is selected. The material system has a resonant frequency associated therewith for a given operational environment. A structure is formed that includes a non-electrically-conductive material and the material system. The structure incorporates the electrically-conductive material at least at a surface thereof. The geometry of the structure supports propagation of surface plasmon polaritons at a selected frequency that is approximately equal to the resonant frequency of the material system. As a result, heavy electrons are produced at the electrically-conductive material as the surface plasmon polaritons propagate along the structure.",,,,,,

"Two ways of mastering nuclear fusion energy, viz., controlled thermonuclear fusion and cold fusion, are considered. This paper deals with the intensive cold fusion model, hereinafter referred to as the chemonuclear fusion hypothesis. The determining role of virtual photons and electrons of anomalous internal gamma-conversion in cold fusion is shown. The chemonuclear fusion hypothesis for the 2D-, HD- and (7Li–1H)gas-transition metal systems provides an explanation of cold fusion. It is demonstrated that this hypothesis can serve as a base for the development of cold fusion reactors.",,,,,,

"The work is devoted to experimental check of the intensive cold fusion model (the chemonuclear fusion scenario) developed. For experiments, the experimental device of cold fusion energy in HD–nickel system has been made. To create an ""active pseudocomposite"" layer (offered in V.F. Zelensky, The Int. Conf. on Cold Fusion-20. Japan, 2016) on the electrode surface, an operating procedure has been developed for processing nickel electrodes of the energy generator. All the phenomena expected in the chemonuclear fusion scenario were observed in the ""verification experiment"" (except gamma-radiation caused by the bineutron–nickel nucleus interaction). The conclusion is drawn that the chemonuclear fusion scenario successfully explains the process of intensive cold fusion in three fusion systems (2D–, HD– and (7Li–1H)gas-transitive metal), and thus, can form the basis for the development of cold fusion reactors.",,,,,,

We find that the hydrogen concentration in PdHx is much less than the equilibrium value and give a simple criterion for the existence of phases occurring during CV. The voltammetric electro-sorption of H into Pd and electro-desorption of H from Pd are controlled by the adsorption of H on Pd and diffusion of H in Pd, respectively. By comparison with the previous experimental results, it is concluded that there are two sorts of adsorption, strong and weak playing key roles in H absorption into Pd at anodic and cathodic overpotentials (vs. RHE), respectively.",,,,,,

The kinetics of a thin layer Pd H(D) electrode at the coexistence of α and β phases in cyclic voltammetry are studied and the effects of various parameters are discussed. It is found that the voltammogram of the α ↔ β phase transition is trigonal in shape which differs significantly from those for diffusion and adsorption. The kinetic characteristics of the α + β mixed region are controlled by the deviation of parameters from the thermodynamic values. These results indicate that cyclic voltammetry can be used for studying the kinetics of phase transition occurring in a layer electrode. The present treatment is verified by comparison with the previous experimental results.,,,,,,

On the other hand, a plate with both sides exposed to electrolyte absorbs hydrogen more rapidly than that with only one side exposed to electrolyte under the same equivalent thickness and other conditions.

"Excess heat was observed in the Pd|D2O electrolytic system using a Calvet type microcalorimeter. It was found that the average excess power was 0.025 W over 79 hours period. This result corresponds to a volume excess power of 8.75 W /cm^3 Pd or a surface excess power of 0.044 W /cm^2 Pd, and a specific excess heat of 2.48 MJ/cm^3 Pd or 228 eV/atom Pd. The current density and D/Pd ratio for excess power production were lower than the recognized ‘threshold' values 100-150 mA/cm^2 and 0.83-0.92 D/Pd, this indicates that the critical requirement for reproduction of the anomalous heat can be ‘cut down' using high sensitivity calorimetry.

"Based on the thermodynamics involving the lattice expansion due to hydrogen insertion, the interaction between hydrogen atoms and the blocking effect in hydrogen diffusion, we discuss the profiles of hydrogen concentration and self-induced stress, and their interaction in the steady state during hydrogen diffusion across elastic membranes of fcc metals or alloys. Contrary to the conventional viewpoint, it is found that the selfinduced stress suppresses the departure of the concentration distribution from the linearity. The residual stress profile depends on the phase of metal-hydrogen system. However, the diffusion flux is independent of the existence and magnitude of self-stress; this conclusion means that the conventional steady-state method for measurement of the diffusion coefficient can be applied experimentally even while the self-stress effect is significant. Finally, although these results are obtained from the fcc metal-hydrogen system, our conclusions can be extended to the diffusion problem of other interstitials in solid samples.",,,,,,

"On the basis of the thermokinetics of the hydrogen (deuterium) evolution reaction and the thermodynamics of Pd+H(D) system, we analytically and numerically discuss effects of temperature on the loading ratio of hydrogen (deuterium) absorption into electrodes of β-phase PdHx (PdDx) under the galvanostatic charging condition. It is found that the change of the loading ratio with temperature depends on the absorption enthalpy, adsorption enthalpy and apparent activation energy of the exchange current density of the Tafel reaction. Our theoretical predictions fit the available experimental results well.",,,,,,

Another fact that has been omitted in past work is that the temperature coefficients of PdHx resistance and resistivity increase while x > 0.7.

On the other hand, the overall system is in an unstable state after a long time charging; this makes the determination of hydrogen diffusivity difficult in experiments.

At the same time, effects of other parameters on values of ADC are discussed as well. The theoretical results are qualitatively consistent with the available experimental data.

Stable excess heat is generated by events on or near the Pd cathode surface. In addition to the stable excess heat, heat bursts are sometimes observed. These occurred most frequently in experiments using 2 mm diameter tubes for the cathodes. Excess heat measured by isoperibolic calorimetry is directly verified by Seebeck envelope calorimetry. Experiments with D2 SO4 replacing H2SO4 in heavy water electrolyte showed that there was no affect on excess heat production.

"The LEC, a simple device producing electrical energy, was discovered by American scientists Frank Gordon and Harper J Whitehouse. They have described it as a ‘contact potential difference device’. The two electrode plates that form the cell are not in physical contact, being separated by any one of a number of gases. Various experiments and their results are described, typically ones where the surface of a ‘working electrode’ is co-deposited with hydrogen and another metal, for example Fe or Pd. Voltage is measured between a carefully washed and dried working electrode and a plain metal counter electrode, the distance between them is 0.5-1mm. The interstitial gas may be hydrogen, deuterium, air or other gases, and a voltage of several hundred millivolts can be measured [Ref. 1]. Alan Smith, a British scientist, created working electrodes by simple electrolysis of metal plates in light water without co-deposition and reproduced the LEC effect with different metals. [Ref. 4]. Recently Qiuran Laboratory has devoted considerable time to studying the LEC effect and we present some preliminary experimental results in which LEC phenomena have been observed. These experiments are qualitative ones in which iron plating, nickel plating, copper plating and electrolysis are used to activate working electrode surfaces and electrical measurements made to determine if LEC voltage is generated. Since the results reported here are ‘early stage’ we confess the methods are not yet refined, and we suffered some problems, including hydrogen valve leaks.",,,,,,

"A heavy water reflux open-electrolytic cell was developed, which features a branch tube on the upper part of the cell for the gas outlet and condensed D2O reflow, which differs from the isoperibolic cell used by Fleischmann-Pons and Miles. The evaporation rate (4.32I in µg/s) and power (9.79I in mW) of D2O in open electrolysis at 25°C are small constants, which are almost independent from the atmosphere pressure, and the power balance is therefore simplified. Mass losses in D2O electrolysis were measured, and the results verified that the actual amounts of evaporation were consistent with the theoretical values within 4% under careful design and operation. Excess power in the Pd(Pt)-D2O+LiOD (H2O+LiOH) cell were measured by a Seebeck envelope calorimeter with a higher sensitivity than our previous calorimeter. Four phenomena were observed: (1) Excess power was more readily observed in Pt-D2O(H2O) than in Pd-D2O system. The maximum average excess power was 59 ± 7 mW with average input power of 2.5 W for Pt-D2O system and 90 ± 3 mW with average input power of 1.5 W for Pt-H2O system. The reasons are still unclear so far, and this phenomenon has puzzled us for quite a while because the Pt-D2O(H2O) cell was always considered the reference system in past experiments. (2) The maximum average excess power was 19 ± 9 mW with average input power of 4.1 W and 46 ± 3 mW with input power of 2.9 W for the Pd-Cu and Pd-B rods, respectively, provided by Melvin H. Miles. (3) The open electrolysis is in unsteady state, and this state can be divided into 2 categories ? long-term shift (LTS) and short-term fluctuation (STF), which responds to the input power changing over time. For long-term shift, the instantaneous excess power must be compensated by the change rate of input power. For short-term fluctuation, the data logging rate cannot follow or reflect the changing of input power, and the input power is always overestimated; the resulted output power may be less than the input power for all cells. (4) The concentration of LiOD in the electrolyte decreased with time during electrolysis and it was found that LiOD had turned into a precipitate of Lithium silicate (Li2SiO3), which was verified by X-Ray Diffraction. All these factors make the calorimetry complicated, and the exact reproduction of excess heat in open-cells must be done carefully.",,,,,,

"In cold fusion research, the LiOD heavy water solution has been used as electrolyte in Pd-D2O electrolytic systems for over 30 years. The conductivity of LiOD not only affects the electrical and thermal properties but also can be used to determine the LiOD concentration. In this paper, conductivities of LiOD heavy water solution (0.01409 ~ 0.09721 mol*L^-1) at 10 ~ 70 deg C were measured. Changes of conductivity ? in mS*cm^-1 with concentration c in mol*L^-1 and temperature T in degrees C can be expressed by the quadratic form: ? = 60.56c – 14.25c^2 + 2.514cT – 0.5459c^2T. This relationship can be simplified to ? = 123.41c – 27.90c^2 or c = 8.1031 x 10^-3 ?^2 + 1.484 × 10^-5 ?^2 at 25 deg C.",,,,,,

"Our model applies solid state, nuclear, and quantum mechanics principles to the molecular chemistry process. We show how most of our predicted transmutation products are consistent with experimental data from a wide variety of LENR experiments, and how they can be triggered. Chemical physics recently discovered a new type of chemical reaction that concentrated most of the energy of reactants into electrons that were originally trapped between reactants. The reaction leaves the reaction product molecule relatively cool. Considering the rules of solid state physics, we apply the pattern of these chemical reactions to nuclear reactions, referred to as ""Lattice Enabled Nuclear Reactions"" (LENR, also called ""Low Energy Nuclear Reactions""). The predicted nuclear energy release also concentrates the energy in electrons, energized inside the nuclear product. The nuclear products are predicted to be ""cold"", implying non-radioactive, ground state. In some cases the excitation energy of the compound nucleus is sufficient to fracture it into more isotopes that were not originally present. The total attraction energy (coulomb plus nuclear) can overcome the quantum kinetic energy repulsion of the squeezed electron quasi-particles (Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle) when the effective electron mass exceeds a threshold value. . . .",,,,,,

"Our proposed three-body model attempts to understand the transmutations that have been observed in many experiments. The model combines several phenomena to derive the conditions where a binding potential energy and an electron’s Coulomb bond can combine to attract the ions together to form a new nucleus. We hypothesize that heavy electron quasiparticles are created by placing electrons near inflection points of a lattice band diagram and last about one collision time (~10 fs). They are placed near the inflection point by injection of phonons carrying crystal momentum, which last picoseconds, long enough to create many generations of transient heavy electron quasiparticles. We consider the interaction of two ions, such as a nickel nucleus and a proton, separated by a distance x with an electron of mass m trapped between them. The increase in energy needed to confine the electron (Kinetic Energy of Confinement, KEC) ? 1/(mx2) from the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle acts like a repulsive potential. . . .",,,,,,
