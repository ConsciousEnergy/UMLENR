Palladium and titanium loaded electrolytically and titanium loaded directly with deuterium gas have been reported to emit neutrons. Interestingly gas loading experiments involving Pd-D have not been reported so far. Such experiments were therefore conducted recently in our group. Tritium measurements in gas loaded Pd-D targets have been carried out. The present paper summarises the results obtained so far to ascertain whether cold fusion reactions occur in gas loaded Pd targets also.,Unknown,Bombay,Unknown

Conference Proceedings,1990,Three Dimensional Computer Simulation of an Isoperibolic Calorimeter for Cold Fusion Experiments,The First Annual Conference on Cold Fusion,1,Unknown,308,National Cold Fusion Institute,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,The three dimensional heat conduction computer code HEATING5 was used to simulate the isoperibolic calorimeter being used for cold fusion experiments at Stanford University. The simulation results confirm the measured temperature distribution in the calorimeter. Computer analysis also demonstrates that temperature measurements for this particular calorimeter are independent of the heat source position in the calorimeter. A numerical procedure was developed to derive the transient behavior of the heat generation in the cold fusion cell from the transient temperature measurements. This procedure was exercised using a measured temperature pulse. The transient behavior of the power pulse was in the form of square-wave and its magnitude was slightly higher than the on-line calculation based on a steady-state approach.,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

Conference Proceedings,1990,Statistical Analysis of Neutron Emission in Cold Fusion Experiments,The First Annual Conference on Cold Fusion,1,Unknown,175,National Cold Fusion Institute,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,The paper discusses two techniques for studying the multiplicity spectrum of neutron emission in cold fusion experiments. In the first method the multiplicity distribution of counts in 20 ms time intervals is analysed to give information about the statistics of neutron emission in cold fusion. The results of six such experiments indicate that about 10 to 25% of the neutrons produced in cold fusion are emitted in the form of bunches 400 to 600 neutrons each. The other method discussed is an adaptation of the Artificial Dead Time method developed originally for reactor noise analysis as well as for the passive neutron assay of plutonium. An expression for the fractional loss of counts in the presence of dead time is derived. It is shown that a neutron detection efficiency of ~ 1% is adequate to estimate the average multiplicity as well as the fraction of bunched neutron emission in the presence of a Poisson background.,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

Report,1990,Distributed bosonic states and condensed matter fusion,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,NRL,Unknown,theory,Unknown,This paper presents a theory of condensed matter fusion in crystals based on the periodic potential provided by an ordered lattice and the approximate Bose statistics obeyed by bosons on length scales associated with electrostatic interactions. The resulting nuclear interaction proceeds in a manner that approximately preserves either the initial periodicity of the lattice or the periodicity of a commensurate lattice. Reaction reversibility over timescales associated with electrostatic interaction results in condensed matter fusion being dominated by interactions in which both the products and reactants obey Bose-Einstein statistics. As a result tritium release and 3He+ production should not appear as primary fusion products.,Unknown,Washington,Unknown

The count rate of neutron (CRN) bunched for 3 h showed no significant increase at low current densities. High CRN appeared a few days later after the current increased to 102.4 mA/cm2 and the temperature was raised to 50°C. In two experiments CRN and neutron energy spectrum of 2.45 MeV was reproduced.,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

Formation of ion band-state deuterium is thermo-dynamically favored when lattice strain energy is greater than the incremental chemical potential of the band state. The key fusion step is a coalescence fluctuation that converts a twofold occupation state of electrostatic zero-point-motion size into a state of nuclear dimensions. Rates are calculated using the Fermi Golden Rule. Fusion energy is shared between band-state members and subsequently transferred to the lattice.,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

Conference Proceedings,1992,Tritium and Helium Production in Palladium Electrodes and the Fugacity of Deuterium Therein,Unknown,1,Unknown,231,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,An account is given of the massive production of tritium at a Pd electrode. Production continued for ~ 750 hours after which time it was arbitrarily curtailed. Production of T was found to cease every few days but could be resuscitated by increasing the overpotential of the electrode reaction. A logarithmic relation between the rate of tritium production and the overpotential of the electrode reaction was established. The Will-Cedzynska method of examining T contamination in specimens has shown that nothing above the background of T was detected if no D2O had been electrolytically evolved on the Pd specimens concerned.,Unknown,Nagoya Japan,Unknown

A low-background high-resolution Ge detector surrounded by neutron scatterers was used to investigate the fast (1 ~ 5 MwC neutrons. The neutron flux was obtained by measuring rates of the gamma rays following inelastic scattering of the fast neutrons from nuclei in the scatterers. The observed spectrum shows no significantly significant excess of gamma rays above background. . . .,Unknown,Nagoya Japan,Unknown

A,184,Unknown,149,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,By heating a TiT0.0035 preparation consisting of extremely small monocrystalline particles (diameter &#8776; 15 nm) a decrease of the radioactivity by 40% was observed. In further experiments the concentration of tritium in such preparations was varied (TiTx experiments) showing that the radioactivity of the tritium increased less than proportionally to its concentration. Careful analysis of the experiments seems to rule out the possibility of trivial errors. A provisional hypothetical explanation is formulated. Our experiments may point to a connection with cold DD-fusion.,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

Conference Proceedings,1996,Electrochemical loading of hydrogen and deuterium into palladium and palladium-boron alloys,Unknown,1,Unknown,208,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Excess power production and other anomalous effects have been observed during the electrolysis of heavy water using palladium and palladium-boron alloys as the cathode materials. This study focused on hydrogen and deuterium loading into palladium and palladium-boron alloys. Improved calorimetry provided for the detection of the exothermic heat of absorption of deuterium into palladium and palladium-alloy cathodes. The addition of boron to palladium does not significantly affect the initial loading rate but slows further loading to higher levels. The presence of boron in the palladium significantly slows the rate of the deloading process. Cracks or other surface defects prevent high loading levels of hydrogen or deuterium into palladium or palladium-boron alloys.,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

Conference Proceedings,1996,Investigation of Nuclear Emissions in the Process of D(H) Escaping from Deuterized (Hydrogenized) PdO-Pd-PdO and PdO-Ag Samples,Unknown,1,Unknown,345,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Emission of proton-like and neutron-like events was observed in the process of escaping deuterium from deuterized PdO-Pd-Ag and PdO-Pd-PdO samples. The ratio of the proton-like and neutron-like event fluxes was estimated as Np/Nn ~ 1.The charged particle emission was also observed in the process of escaping hydrogen from hydrogenized PdO-Pd-Ag and PdO-Pd-PdO samples. The emitted charged particles may be identified asprotons and a-particles. Investigation of charged-particle emission was carried out by 3 methods: (1) plastic scintillation counter; (2) Si-SSD; (3) CR-39 plastic track detector. The results obtained by these independent methods are in good agreement with each other.An effect of the weak thermal neutron flux on the processesof cold fusion in the samples loaded with D(H) was also investigated. It was observed that the flux of neutrons emitted from deuterized PdO-Pd-Ag samples exposed by thermal neutrons was approximately 300 times as large as in the case of unexposed samples.,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

Conference Proceedings,1998,Unknown,The Seventh International Conference on Cold Fusion,1,Unknown,180,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Abstract Yields of protons emitted in the D + D reaction in Pd and PdO thick targets were measured for bombarding energies between 2.5 and 10 keV. The obtained yields were compared with those predicted by using the parameterization of cross sections at higher energies. It was found that both of the yields for Pd and PdO are surprisingly larger than the prediction. The bombarding energy dependence of the yields are well described with screening potential parameters; Ue = 250 eV for Pd and 600 eV for PdO. The significance of a simple extrapolation of the observed enhancement is discussed.,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

Chem.,458,Unknown,107,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,The kinetics of a thin layer Pd H(D) electrode at the coexistence of &#945; and &#946; phases in cyclic voltammetry are studied and the effects of various parameters are discussed. It is found that the voltammogram of the &#945; &#8596; &#946; phase transition is trigonal in shape which differs significantly from those for diffusion and adsorption. The kinetic characteristics of the &#945; + &#946; mixed region are controlled by the deviation of parameters from the thermodynamic values. These results indicate that cyclic voltammetry can be used for studying the kinetics of phase transition occurring in a layer electrode. The present treatment is verified by comparison with the previous experimental results.,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

Conference Proceedings,2000,Trace Elements Added to Palladium by Exposure to Gaseous Deuterium,8th International Conference on Cold Fusion,1,Unknown,129,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,This is an experimental program to investigate possible trace element changes brought about in palladium (Pd) after extensive electrolysis in heavy water electrolytes as well as long time contact of particulate Pd with gaseous deuterium. Of particular interest are cathodes and particulate Pd which had experienced episodes of excess heat production beyond all electrical and other inputs. This paper details the careful analysis by neutron activation analysis (NAA) of a set of three samples of finely powdered Pd exposed to high deuterium pressures (hundreds of atmospheres) near room temperature at the core of hollow cylindrical Pd cathodes. A fourth sample of unused Pd powder from the same batch used in the cathodes was analyzed as a control. The most prominent change observed in the three active samples versus the virgin Pd was the Zn-64 content. The active samples showed an increase in the Zn-64 isotope of 6 to 14 times that in the virgin Pd. Speculation regarding the source of this increased zinc varies from contamination during electron beam welding (used to seal off the hollow core) to nuclear reactions generated by high pressure deuterium gas on the large surface area Pd particles in the core.,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

The time-resolved mass spectra for Pd deuteride revealed tritium (T) production during the out-diffusion experiment. Similar time behaviors of mass number 1-4 and 6 in the spectra was also observed for Pd hydride. Film blackening was observed for most Pd deuteride as well as Pd hydrides using a normal monochromatic negative photographic film. The radiation from the Pd plate consists of two kinds of components for a Pd hydride. Secondary ion mass spectroscopy has shown considerable increase in counts of Li for Pd hydride after the out-diffusion experiment.,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

Conference Proceedings,2002,In-Situ Charactorization of Sputtered Pd Thin-Films Undergoing Electrolysis,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Tsinghua Univ. Press,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,In-situ measurements on the resistance and temperature variations of Pd thin films are carried out during electrolysis. The measurement is made possible by covering parts of the Pd films with a protective layer of thermal and electric insulators. Electrical contacts are made by using either silver epoxy or indium soldering. The resistance-loading curve deviates somewhat from the typical curve for a bulk Pd/H(D) system. The initial resistance increase shows a much faster hydrogen diffusion rate along the film axis than that observed in bulk systems. The characteristic resistance-loading curve is explained by the electronic band structures of Pd loaded with different H(D) fractions. An excess heat of 30% during the electrolysis process was detected using an open  calorimeter and a novel circuit switching methodology. The corresponding excess power density reaches 100 W/cm^3.,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

The basic principles of construction and the parameters of an experimental setup ensuring such a supercompression are described. The model and method of creation and evolution of superheavy nuclear clusters with 250&lt;<i>A</i>&lt;500 and <i>A</i>&gt;3000-5000 in the controlled collapse zone and in the volume of a remote accumulating screen are discussed. The evolution of such clusters results in the synthesis of isotopes with 1&lt;<i>A</i>&lt;500 and with anomalous spatial distribution in the volume of a remote screen. These phenomena were interpreted on the basis of the idea of the formation of a self-organizing and self-supporting collapse of the electron-nucleus plasma under the action of a coherent driver up to a state close to the nuclear substance.,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

In 1995 a fourth condition was added with the recognition [5] that (iv) deuterium flux plays an important role in determining the excess heat power density.,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

This occurs by controlling the action of an oriented crystal matrix on the motion of conversion electrons. The same effect takes place at any beta-processes (including at decay of a neutron with an emission of electrons and neutrino). It was shown that parameters of internal electron conversion decay greatly depended on the structure of the crystal matrix and on the distance between the excited nucleus and the crystal matrix.,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

Conference Proceedings,2005,Unknown,The 12th International Conference on Condensed Matter Nuclear Science,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,theory,Unknown,The most basic theoretical challenge for understanding low energy nuclear reaction (LENR) and transmutation reaction (LETR) in condensed matters is to find mechanisms by which the large Coulomb barrier between fusing nuclei can be overcome.  A unifying theory of LENR and LETR has been developed to provide possible mechanisms for the LENR and LETR processes in matters based on high-density nano-scale and micro-scale quantum plasmas.  It is shown that recently developed theoretical models based on Bose-Einstein Fusion (BEF) mechanism and Quantum Plasma Nuclear Fusion (QPNF) mechanism are applicable to the results of many different types of LENR and LETR experiments,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

Conference Proceedings,2007,Anomalous heat Generation by surface oxidized Pd wires in a hydrogen atmosphere,Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Anomalies in Hydrogen / Deuterium Loaded Metals,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Thin Pd wires (diameter 50 micrometers) surface oxidized through joule heating have been loaded in a hydrogen (H2) atmosphere at pressures in the range 1 - 10 bar. The atomic ratio H/Pd reached in the experimental conditions has been evaluated through its relationship with the electrical resistivity of hydrogen-loaded Pd. It was found that the loading rate of the surface oxidized Pd wires is exceptionally higher than with the untreated ones (full loading in a few minutes as compared with several hours). It was also observed that surface treated wires with H/Pd = 0.75 do not lose hydrogen even when joule heated at temperatures up to about 150°C in a Hydrogen atmosphere. When the wire temperature exceeds 150°C (applied power about 12.4 W) anomalous heat generation (about 3.5 W) was detected.,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

Journal Article,2007,Maruhn-Greiner Maximum of Uranium Fission for Confirmation of Low Energy Nuclear Reactions LENR via a Compound Nucleus with Double Magic Numbers,J. Fusion Energy,26,Unknown,349,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,One of the most convincing facts about LENR due to deuterons of very high concentration in host metals as palladium is the measurement of the large scale minimum of the reaction probability depending on the nucleon number A of generated elements at A = 153 where a local maximum was measured. This is similar to the fission of uranium at A = 119 where the local maximum follows from the Maruhn-Greiner theory if the splitting nuclei are excited to about MeV energy. The LENR generated elements can be documented any time after the reaction by SIMS or K-shell X-ray excitation to show the very unique distribution with the local maximum. An explanation is based on the strong Debye screening of the Maxwellian deuterons within the degenerate rigid electron background especially within the swimming electron layer at the metal surface or at interfaces. The deuterons behave like neutrals at distances of about 2 picometers. They may form clusters due to soft attraction in the range above thermal energy. Clusters of 10 pm diameter may react over long time probabilities (megaseconds) with Pd nuclei leading to a double magic number compound nucleus which splits like in fission to the A = 153 element distribution.,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

Conference Proceedings,2008,Radiochemical Observations for Comparison of Uranium Fission with Low Energy Nuclear Reactions LENR,American Physical Society Meeting,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,theory,Unknown,The discovery of nuclear fission by Hahn and Straßmann was based on a very rare microanalytical result what initially could not indicate the very complicated details of this most important process. A similarity is discussed for the low energy nuclear reactions (LENR) being proved from analogies of measurements of uranium fission. The distribution of the elements with uranium fission is similar to the element distribution with LENR. This was observed repeatedly and reproducibly with high density deuteron concentration in palladium. This discussion is specifically focussed to the Maruhn-Greiner local maximum of the distribution within the large-scale minimum if the fission nuclei are excited. The consequences of the complications in uranium fission are discussed in comparison with LENR with respect to the studies of a hypothetical fissioning compound nuclear reaction via a concluded element 306X126 with double magic numbers.,Unknown,New Orleans,Unknown

Conference Proceedings,2009,Clusters with Picometer Distance of Deuterons and LENR (PowerPoint slides),15th International Conference on Condensed Matter Nuclear Science,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,ENEA,Unknown,Theory,Unknown,The probability of pm-Ms reactions for low energy nuclear reactions LENR and the semiempirical derivation of 2 pm deuteron screening on palladium with a reduction factor 14 in Coulomb repulsion compared with a usual plasma factor 5 was confirmed later by direct experiments. Generation of 2pm distance clusters of about 150 deuterons based on this screening and possibly by a Casimir force permitted understanding of compound reactions as measured with the 155 nucleon minimum measured at LENR. These kinds of deuteron clusters were directly measured by SQUID. Based on screening and comparable values of a Wigner-Seitz radius for very dense deuteron clusters of stable Rydberg matter in defects of iron oxide with measured 2.3 pm nuclear distance is another access which may lead to an understanding of the LENR processes.,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

We have designed and tested a calorimeter utilizes an “exploding wire” technique to examine the effect of a destructive electrodiffusion on a highly loaded PdDx wire. We have shown that highly loaded PdDx wires can be formed using high voltage electrolysis of very high purity D2O with a very thin Pd wire cathode and a thin Pt wire anode. The addition a partial monolayer of a recombination poison yields a highly loaded PdDx cathode. Following that step with the addition of a larger amount of that same poison seals the loaded wire and allows transfer to a cryogenic calorimeter. Our liquid nitrogen boil-off cryogenic calorimeter has been shown to have an accuracy of less than 0.4 J.,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

Journal Article,2011,Coherent Energy Exchange in the Strong Coupling Limit of the Lossy Spin-Boson Model,J. Condensed Matter Nucl. Sci.,5,Unknown,116,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,We focus on the lossy spin-boson model since it is capable of efficient energy exchange between two-level systems and an oscillator under conditions where the characteristic energy of the oscillator is small compared to the transition energy of the two-level systems. We are considering this model as the essential component for a theoretical understanding of the excess heat effect in the Fleischmann-Pons experiment. We introduce an iterative algorithm that allows the numerical calculation of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the coefficient eigenvalue equation that arises in the local approximation. From systematic calculations in the strong coupling limit we establish scaling laws for the self-energy and for the indirect coupling matrix element in the local approximation. These results are used to study the system dynamics for simple strong coupling models.,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

Report,2011,Nuclear Reactions in Micro/Nano-Scale Metal Particles,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Purdue Nuclear and Many Body Theory Group (PNMBTG),Unknown,Unknown,Theory,Low-energy nuclear reactions in micro/nano-scale metal particles are described based on the theory of Bose-Einstein condensation nuclear fusion (BECNF). The BECNF theory is based on a single basic assumption capable of explaining the observed LENR phenomena; deuterons in metals undergo Bose-Einstein condensation. The BECNF theory is also a quantitative predictive physical theory. Experimental tests of the basic assumption and theoretical predictions are proposed. Potential application to energy generation by ignition at low temperatures is described. Generalized theory of BECNF is used to carry out theoretical analyses of recently reported experimental results for hydrogen-nickel system.,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

Journal Article,2014,Bose–Einstein Condensation and Inverted Rydberg States in Ultra-high Density Deuterium Clusters Related to Low Energy Nuclear Reactions,J. Condensed Matter Nucl. Sci.,13,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Results about low energy nuclear reactions (LENR) are related to very high density clusters of deuterons where properties of Bose-Einstein condensation and/or inverted Rydberg states are compared. A modification of Bohr’s atom model is used to overcome the problem that a quantum state with n = 1 does not emit radiation from an “orbiting” electron. This permits then the description of the inverted state of Rydberg matter in agreement with the recent measurements of Holmlid et al. for deuterium clusters with ultra-high deuteron densities in the range of 1029cm-3. A virtual oscillation model for laser excitation clusters explains the low intensity ionization threshold in clusters. MeV particle emission from LENR can then be compared with measurements from inverted Rydberg states.,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

In this investigation we conducted a long hydrogen exposure to see if palladium electrode delamination occurred due to chemical reactions and it was found that after seven days the electrode did not delaminate. A pressurized deuterium run was conducted immediately following the hydrogen exposure on the same sensor and some interesting count burst data was observed. Further analysis is required to determine what the observed effect could be  attributed to.,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

This method is shown to lead to rapid formation of a strongly correlated particle state that provides an almost complete clearing of the potential barrier even for a narrow range of oscillator frequency variations. Several successful low energy fusion experiments based on usage of correlated states of interacting particles are discussed.,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

Journal Article,2015,Explaining Cold Fusion,J. Condensed Matter Nucl. Sci.,15,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Theory,Unknown,Five assumptions are used to create a new explanation of low energy nuclear reactions (cold fusion) based on formation of a novel active environment within a variety of materials. The method to form this environment and the nuclear consequences are described. The fusion process is proposed to occur when a form of metallic hydrogen is created in nano-cracks. Methods to test the model are provided. Engineering variables are identified and used to show how the process can be controlled and amplified. These assumptions can also be used to evaluate other proposed explanations.,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

Report,2017,Investigation of the nickel-hydrogen anomalous heat effect,Unknown,Unknown,ATR-2017-01760,Unknown,Report No. ATR-2017-01760,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Experimental work was undertaken to reproduce a specific observation of the gas-phase Anomalous Heat Effect (AHE)*.  This task required the production of a quantity of heat energy by a mass of material so small that the origin of the energy cannot be attributable to a chemical process.  The gas-phase form of AHE is difficult to reproduce and hence lacks a measure of credibility.  The goal is to enhance its credibility by reproducing results first demonstrated in Japan and later reproduced in the U.S. by a solitary investigator.  The technique heated nanometer-sized Ni:Pd particles (20:1 molar ratio) embedded in micron-sized particles of an inert refractory of ZrO2. It was not within the purview of this work to investigate the physical origin of the AHE effect or speculate on its source.,Unknown,The Aerospace Corporation,Unknown

In Russia Andrei Sakharov is credited in 1947 with muon catalyzed fusion soon after Soviet Communists pillaged Jun Shitagau Noguchi's Nitchitsu or Nihon Chisso factories in Eastern Part of North Korea called Hamgyong Province and in ihe United States a decade later Luis Alvarez is credited with muon catalyzed fusion just after United States military had returned from visiting ruins of Noguchi's Nitchitsu industries.

Journal Article,2019,High-temperature Calorimetric Measurements of Heat for Ni/H2 Exothermic Reactions,J. Condensed Matter Nucl. Sci.,29,Unknown,41,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Instrumentation developed to measure heat power from a high-temperature reactor for experimental trials lasting several weeks is being applied to gas-phase Ni/H2 LENR. We developed a reactor that can maintain and record temperatures in excess of 1200° C while monitoring pressures exceeding 7 bar. This reactor is inserted into a flowing-fluid calorimeter that allows both temperature rise and flow rate of the cooling fluid to be redundantly measured by different physical principles. A computerized data acquisition system was written to automate the collection of more than 20 physical parameters with simultaneous numerical and dual graphical displays comprising both a strip chart and complete history of key parameters. Initial studies of the absorption of light hydrogen (H2) by nickel are presented.,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

Sci.,31,Unknown,49,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,The Eyring Absolute Rate Theory is generally applied to chemical reactions where bonds between atoms are broken and new bonds formed to give a transition state or activated complex. This theory has also been applied to physical rate processes such as diffusion and the viscosity of liquids. The activation parameters obtained from the Eyring theory when applied to cold fusion are all suggestive of a deuterium fusion rate controlled by the diffusion of deuterons within the palladium lattice. The D+D fusion process in the Pd/D system is apparently a zero-ordered reaction where only a small fraction of the reactants are in a location in which they are able to react.,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

Sci.,36,Unknown,1,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Continuing development of Lattice Energy Converter (LEC) technology has resulted in both experimental and theoretical advancements. Replicated experimental results and analysis for a LEC wherein a codeposited palladium-hydrogen working electrode produced spontaneous and sustained electrical energy attributed to ionizing radiation have been previously reported. Herein is reported the use of a working electrode comprised of codeposited iron-hydrogen from an aqueous solution of FeCl2 which demonstrated similar capabilities to produce spontaneous and sustained electrical energy as well as ionizing radiation. These results also have been replicated. http://ikkem.com/iccf23/PPT/Invited%20Gordon%20ICCF%2023%20LEC%20T5.MP4.
