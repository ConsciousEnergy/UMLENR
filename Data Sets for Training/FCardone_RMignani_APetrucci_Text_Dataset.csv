"Roma, Italy 4LNF-Istituto Nazionale di  Fisica  Nucleare Via Enrico Fermi 40 - 00044 Frascati (Rome), Italy *  Correspondent  author:   Abstract  The purpose of this paper is to place side by side the experimental results of Piezonu- clear reactions, which have been recently unveiled, and those collected during the last twenty years of experiments on low energy nuclear reactions (LENR). We will briefly re- port the results of our campaign of piezonuclear reactions experiments where ultrasounds and"
"cavitation n were applied to solutions of stable elements. These outcomes will be shown to be compatible with the results and evidences obtained from low energy nuclear reac- tion experiments. Some theoretical concepts and ideas, on which our experiments are grounded, will be sketched and it will be shown that, in order to trigger our measured effects, it exists an energy threshold, that has to be overcome, and a maximum inter- val of time for this energy to be released to the nuclear system. Eventually, a"
"research hy pothesis will be put forward about the chance to raise the level of analogy from the mere comparison of results up to the phenomenological level. Here, among the various evidences collected in LENR experiments, we will search for hints about the overcome of the energy threshold and about the mechanism that releases the loaded energy in a suitable interval of time.   Evidences of Piezonuclear reactions  All of the experiments that we have carried out, involved the application of ultrasounds with"
"a frequency  of 20 kHz and suitable power (most of the times around 100 W) to liquids. These liquids were either bidistilled deionised water [, , ] or solutions of bidistilled- deionised water and some standard chemical elememts [, ]. In the two experiments reported in [, ] samples of bidistilled and deionised water were subjected to cavitation for different intervals of time: 210 minute long cavitation induced an increase of the proportion of a few high mass number stable isotopes (including uranium); four"
"successive c avitations, each one lasting for 10 minutes, with 15 minutes between a cavitation and the next one, gave rise to an increase of the proportion of a few nuclear species within the particular atomic mass range 238<M<264 (including transuranic elements). In the third experiment [], aimed at detecting elements in the so- called rare-earth mass range, ICP mass spectrometry of the solution was performed during five successive cavitations, each one lasting for 15 minutes (with 15-minutes intervals"
"between a cavita tion and the next one). The ICP-MS analysis gave evidence of a significant peak corresponding to a nuclide with atomic mass (137.93±0.01) amu and half-life 12±1 sec, identifed as Eu138. It is known that the abundance on Earth of stable Eu is less than 1.06 ppm (the natural Eu is a mixture of two isotopes, Eu151 with a percentage abundance of 47.77% and Eu153 with 63  63 a percentage abundance of 52.23%). The candidate identied during the third experiment, Eu138, does not exist in nature; it"
"is an articial ra dionuclide (discovered in 1995-97 []) that can be produced at the present time in nuclear reactors and by synchrotrons. There are two ways whereby Eu138 can be produced: by nuclear fission or by nuclear fusion. The former process requires less energy. However, from the results of the first two experiments, the quantity of heavy nuclei, which can produce Eu138 by nuclear fission, is much smaller (by two-three orders of magnitude) than that of the intermediate nuclei that can produce it by"
"fusion. It turns ou t that fusion intermediate of elements is more likely and besides it is the only possible explanation of the changes in concentration of stable elements, induced by cavitation, observed in the first experiments . The ionising radiation measurements, by LR115 detectors, that were carried out during the application of ultrasounds in all of these experiments, did not provide any evidence of ionising radiation above the background level. Further experiments were designed in order to try and"
"detect possible neut ron emission. We subjected to cavitation, bidistilled deionised water, solutions of Lithium, Aluminium, and Iron. No evidences of neutrons were collected with water Lithium and Aluminium. 1It is necessary to warn the reader that ultrasounds and cavitation do not have to be read as the mean to produce hot fusion confined in a collapsing bubble as it was for other experiments conducted by other teams. In the third paragraph the differences between our scope and their will be clarified"
"2The words fission and f usion have been used here. However, it is becoming evident that the outcomes of these piezonuclear reactions experiments, along with those involving low energy nuclear reactions, have nothing to do with the established definitions of fission and fusion. In this sense, these two words have to be interpreted as disgragation of nuclei and union of nuclei respectively. In the following other words will be used like nucleolysis and nucleosynthesis   Iron, conversely, did produce neutrons"
"every time and the mutua lly exclusive experiments stressed that, being equal all the experimental conditions, it was just the presence of Iron to bring about emission of neutrons. Quite bewilderingly, such a heavy and stable element, whose Coulomb barrier is huge, was the trigger of unusual neutron emission. A further unusual circumstance was the lack of the gamma radiation that usually comes along with the emission of neutrons. A further experiment was performed in order to verify the effects of these new"
"mechanisms induced by ul trasounds and cavitation on radioactive nuclei [, , ]. The evidences indicated that the initial quantity of Thorium became half in a interval of time 10000 times faster than Thorium half life. However it turned out that this process was not a mere acceleration of the usual Thorium decay by emission of alpha particles, since the number of tracks on the CR39 detectors that monitored the radioactive process was not compatible with this possibility.  Evidences of Low Energy Nuclear"
"reactions  More than 20 years  have gone since the first announcement of Cold Fusion by Martin Fleis- chmann and Stanley Pons. Since then, despite the aversion that this subject received, an incredible amount of experiments have been carried out in order to reproduce the an- nounced cold fusion effects. Different techniques have been tested and great improvements in reproducibility have been achieved. We will try and group the apparently anomalous results obtained during these years in order to point out"
"the possible analogies among the se outcomes and those collected in the experiments of piezonuclear reactions. Since the goal of this paper is only to show a new possible perspective and promote discussion on it, comprehensiveness is not our main target. In order to summarize the results we will refer to the book ”The Science of Low Energy Nuclear Reactions” by Edmund Storms []. Independently from the the method used to induce LENR (Electrolyte, Plasma, Laser, Diffusion, Fuse, Ambient, Bombard, Biological)"
"it becomes clear that in all of e xperiments there were clear signs of transmutations and that most of the times the resulting products were Iron, Zinc Copper, Nickel, Chromium and other nuclides with comparable mass and binding energy per nucleon (none of them can be considered a light element). Besides, the nuclides belonging to the substrates used in all of the experiments had considerable atomic mass ranging from 48 amu for Ti or 58 amu for Ni up to Pd with 106 amu and further on to W with 184 amu and"
"Au with 197 amu. As to the environm ent in which the substrate was immersed, it contained different substances and chemical compounds which contained much lighter nuclides like H, D, Li, Na, K, C, N, O, Cl, and sometimes other heavier ones compatible with the atomic mass of the nuclides of the substrate. Both in piezonuclear reactions experiments and in LENR experiments there are transmutations 3Iron is at the top of the curve binding energy per nucleon. 4Neutrons were detected by different techniques:"
"bubble detectors, CR39 with Boron layer,  Boron Trifluoride. The evidences collected were compared with neutron signals from standard sources (AmBe) and fast neutron nuclear reactor   that involve heavy mass number nuclides and produce other intermediate and heavy mass number nuclei. These transmutations took place neither by fusion (Coulomb barriers would be too high) nor by fission since the evidences did not show any signs typical of these reactions, like neutron emission or prompt gamma rays or presence"
"of easily de- tectable radionuclides. In  LENR neutron emission was very low and infrequent while in piezonuclear reactions it was not infrequent but nevertheless it was low and certainly not compatible with knonw nuclear reactions, first of all because of the lack of prompt gamma rays and second because no gamma rays from neutron capture by hydrogen was detected either. As to other kinds of radiation emitted during LENR, many different types were detected, which, however have not help in identifying clear"
"common features among the different exper iments and techniques. Among all of them it is worth noting that some teams detected a strange radiation showing unknown features and behaviour [, ] which, from our point of view, could be put beside the strange lack of gamma rays which, at least from hydrogen neutron capture, should be emitted. As it will become clear from the next section, it was not our goal to perform extra power or heat measurements during piezonuclear reaction experiments, and hence no"
"comparison can be made on this ground.  Local Lor entz Invariance Breakdown  The theoretical background, on which our experiments have been designed and carried out, is based on the concept of breakdown of Local Lorentz Invariance (LLI) [, ]. LLI is a symmetry of the laws of Physics which locally, i.e. in a sufficiently small region of space- time, have to stick to the framework of Special Relativity []. This statement has some interwoven consequences on the mathematical form of the laws and on the"
"structure of local space-time. Our theory concentrates on  the structure of local (microscopical) space- time (flat and rigid according to LLI) when LLI is broken. The theory has been built from a phenomenological basis, in the sense that the coefficients of the local Minkowski metric tensor are hypothesized to be function of the energy of the process. The form of these functions have been determined by analysing through this formalism possible anomalous outcomes of experiments probing different fundamental"
"interactions. The dependence of the metric tensor on the e nergy of the physical process means that local space-time is certainly no more rigid and moreover that its geometry can be deformed, just like a blanket which can be furrowed and creased by the energy of a hand. The main consequence of this locally deformed space-time is that it takes an active part in the dynamics of the physical process whose features and flow deeply depart from their usual appearance. The theory predicts that the space-time of"
"strong interactions begins to be deformed when 5In piezonucle ar reactions the heavy nuclides which can be placed side by side to the LENR substrate are those contained in the alloy of the sonotrode 6Of course, being neutrons very rare in both of the type of reactions transmutations by neutron capture are ruled out as well or at least very unlikely.   the energy of the process overcomes a threshold of energy equal to 367.5 GeV [, ]. Besides it clearly states that there is no isochrony between the time of"
"the experimenter and that of the hadronic process. To put it in  a more practical way, this means that in order to deform space-time around a nucleus (or nuclei) and hence trigger ”anomalous” processes, in the fashion of those presented above from piezonuclear reactions, one has to find a microscopical mechanism that loads an amount of energy higher than the energy threshold and then it is capable to release it in an suitable interval of time or in other words it is capable of a suitable power (energy"
"divided by time). This theoretical background shows that our experimen ts was not in wake of the LENR ones, but their target was to obtain some evidences that would corroborate the two predictions mentioned above about the threshold energy and the release mechanism.  LLI and anomalous nuclear processes  It has been shown that the results of LENR experiments and those of piezonuclear re- actions are compatible. Thus, despite the apparent diversity of the experimental setups and conditions, it is possible to"
"hypothesize that similar outcomes are brought about by similar microsco pical mechanisms that trigger alike anomalous nuclear processes. Now, let us evidence the phenomenological aspects that, within piezonuclear experimental setups, fulfill the two conditions mentioned above. Once that these aspects are clear we will try and analyze some LENR setups and evidences in order to make out similar features. First of all it is important to state that piezonuclear reactions have nothing to do with  sonofusion"
"despite the common starting point, i.e. ultrasounds and cavitation. The two  research tracks diverge from the theoretical, phenomenological and experimental points of view []. The collapse of a generic bubble under the huge pressure of ultrasounds, that induces shock-waves on its surface, is regarded as the microscopical mechanism to fulfil the two requirements. Let us recall the evidences obtained in the experiments where neutron emission has been detected [, ]. We subjected to cavitation bidistilled"
"deionised water, a solution of Lithium Chloride, a solution of Aluminium Chloride,  a solution of Iron Chloride and a solution of Iron Nitrate []. Only the two solutions containing Iron emitted neutrons, apparently, without gamma rays above the background level. Besides, the emission of neutrons did not begin as soon as the ultrasounds were turned on.  The  7This value seems quite big, but it is necessary to refer it to a microscopical region (the active reagion or NAE) and to the macroscopical amounts of"
"energy pumped in the every type of LENR experimental setup 8This explains why we hav e never used deuterated substance, never look for Helium or Tritium and never attempted to measure the presence of extra heat. 9Even a short explanation of the differences between the  two  research tracks would be  a digression  from the main target of this  paper.  We  only mention  here that the  collapse of the  bubble  is  not a  mean to increase the temperature of its content, but,  conversely,  a  mean to  accelerate"
"the  ions  trapped on its surface towards each other. For a concise but clear explan ation please refer to the web site    first neutron evidences began to appear after 40 - 50 minutes since ultrasounds had been turned on. These two facts, Iron response and the existence of a delayed emission of neutrons(which has been a constant evidence in every experiment) can be referred to the predicted energy threshold. It is possible to hypothesize that the 40 - 50 minutes were the time to reach and overcome the"
"energy threshold. This hypothesis has to be com- pleted with an important detail. Overcom ing the energy threshold needs to be referred to the context and the environment where the process takes place and in particular to the types of nuclides involved. The experimental conditions were the same for the three types of nuclides, Lithium, Aluminium and Iron. Only the solutions with Iron emitted bursts of neutrons. This can be interpreted in terms of the two conditions mentioned above (about the overcoming of"
"the energy threshold and the interval of time to release it) by saying that Iron, for some  reason, that can be now only conjectured, possesses those peculiar features that make it fulfill, within the experimental conditions, the two prescriptions. The conjecture is that, the collapse of the bubble concentrates energy in a smaller and smaller region of space (which is actually spacetime), making the energy density higher and higher. In this region of spacetime nuclear species are forced. The overcoming of"
"the threshold is achieved by the complementary contributions of the exter- nal energy (ultras ounds) and internal energy, i.e. that of the nuclides taking part in the collapse. The first preliminary clue is that the higher the atomic mass the less external energy and the shorter time interval it takes to deform locally the spacetime. This must be considered only a rough and highly incomplete picture. More variables are certainly involved. It seems that the quantity of bosonic and fermionic isotopes for each"
"nuclide could play an important role as well. Despite the incomplete picture, it is possible  to state that the results of the experiments on piezonuclear reactions (transmutations and neutrons without gamma rays) described in the first part of this paper are brought about by pressure combined with a mechanism that allows an abrupt release of energy within a suitable interval of time. The pressure is produced by ultrasounds, the mechanism is the collapse of the bubble. Their synergy along with nuclides with"
"high atomic mass form the Nuclear Active Environment (NAE) in our experiments. Once that pres sureand bubble collapse have been identified as the conditions to gen- erate a NAE in piezonuclear reactions, let us try and see if it is possible to spot within different experimental setups, where ultrasounds are not used, the counterparts of pres- sure and bubble collapse. Many different setups have been used in LENR experiments 10delayed emission refers to the 40 - 50 minutes mentioned above and has nothing to"
"do with radioactive decay of radionuclides 11Actually, it not clear whether one of the variabl es is atomic mass or binding energy or binding energy per nucleon. 12About the last conjecture, the picture is a lot more complicated since one should distinguish between nuclides that transmute and the results of transmutations 13Critical parameters are the dimension of the bubble and the number of ions of the specific nuclide present on the its surface 14piezo comes from the greek word piezein which means to"
"press   and evidences of nuclear activity have been collected in almost all of them. Due to the in itial character of the clues that this paper puts forward, it certainly does not want to be exhaustive. In this sense, it is interesting to concentrate on the evidences collected by an electrochemical cell with Pd/D co-deposition which, first of all, is the LENR technique more similar to that used by Fleischmann and Pons and more over it seems the farthest, in terms of experimental conditions, from the"
"piezonuclear reactions setup. No pressure seems to be involved, no ultrasounds, no cavitations, and from a  mere visual and audible perspective, it seems much quieter. All of the evidences reported below refer to Pd/D co-deposition experiments and the corresponding control tests. In particular, we refer to the experimental setup and procedure used by Mosier-Boss et al. which is described in []. In their experiments the metals used for the cathode were Ni, Ag, Pt, Au and the solution contained PdCl2 and"
"LiCl2 or KCl2 in heavy water. In control experiments PdCl2 was substituted for CuCl2. The procedure comprised t wo phases. During the first part of the electrolysis, Palladium is reduced on the cathode (Ni, Ag, Pt, Au) and gets plated onto it together with Deuterium. Once the Palladium is plated out, the second phase begins. During this part an external static electric or magnetic field can be either applied or not to the cell and the cathodic current is increased. The details that we are reporting here can"
"be extracted from [, , , ] and the references cited in them. Our purpose is to try and look through them in ord er to make out those features that may corroborate the hypothesis of the existence in the electrolytic technique of a mecha- nism that may fulfill the two requirements mentioned above about the energy threshold and releasing time. Bubble collapse is a far from equilibrium process where energy is locally concentrated around the surface of the bubble and suddenly released with great intensity. In"
"this regard, we will have to look at the whole electrolytic technique and search for leads pointing toward these t hree characteristics (far from equilibrium, local loaded energy,local abrupt release of it). In [] the researchers state that ”the exper- imental protocol covers three time periods”. The first is the co-deposition of Pd/D on the cathode which takes place for several hours at different increasing currents; the sec- ond period is called ”stabilization of the system”, when, at increasing different"
"currents, for several hours, the Pd/D ratio of the co-deposition is let distribute uniformly on the cathode; the t hird period of time is used ”to put the system in a far from equilibrium condition”. This is done by applying an intense static electric or magnetic field and by letting the electrolysis proceed by keeping increasing the current from time to time. It is fairly reasonable to consider that a co-deposition of Pd/D is in itself an unstable structure in which atomic bonding between Palladium atoms"
"are deformed, stretched, and weak- ened by the presence of Deuterium. To confirm this, one can put forward the fact  that LENR experiments have begun to be carried out in the last few years not by loading Deuterium in bulky Palladium, but rather by co-depositions Pd/D or by nanostructured Pd. These methods produce greater quantities of anomalous evidences than those with solid Pd [, , ]. Let us look at this unstable structure of Pd/D from the point of view of the hypothesized NAE in which heavy mass number"
"nuclides play a fundamental role.   From this perspective, Palladium would be the main reactant (precursor) while the  role of Deuterium, loaded among Palladium atoms, would be to load mechanical energy within Pd. Anyway, leaving to further experiments the conjecture of Palladium as the main reactant, that the loading of mechanical energy in Pd is brought about by Deuterium, is confirmed by experiments in which the solution contained CuCl2 instead PdCl2. Copper does not absorbs Deuterium, no lattice"
"deformation is brought about, no mechanical en- ergy gets loaded and hence no reactions take place []. The statements by Stor ms [] in his book seem to move in the same direction. He reports that ”...the basic material used as cathode is not active initially even when it is made of Palladium - activation is required. Nevertheless, the base material does affect the morphology and subsequent activity of the deposited layer...”. The co-deposition or the nano-structures together with heavy atomic mass nuclides,"
"used in the substrates (Pd, Au,Ag,Pt,Ni...), are some of the ingredients to generate a NAE and in particular those ingredient s that allow to store an amount of energy higher than the threshold mentioned above. All of these conjectures can be con- sidered a sound leadfrom the experimental conditions about the possible fulfilment of the first requirement of LLI breakdown hypothesis: existence of an energy threshold. We concentrate now on the second requirement: the mechanism to release this loaded energy."
"Very inspiring in this regard, is the discussion in the papers [, ]. In [] the discussion is about the shape change that was not iced in some areas of the cathode at the end of the electrolysis. The unstable structure at the cathode after Pd/D co-deposition with energy loaded mentioned above is a very complicated configuration of electric layers which, if the current were stopped, would be in a reasonable macroscopical equilibrium but certainly a feeble microscopical one. The application of the intense"
"electric or magnetic field and the increase of the current shake the microscopical equilibrium and produce hot spots randomly distrib uted in position and in time all over the cathode. As stated by the re- searchers in the paper [], ”...a conductor placed in an electric field cannot remain in a stable equilibrium and a negative pressure acts on its surface...”. This pressure is the consequence of forces applied to the surface of the conductor, which, due to the Gauss’ theorem, is affected by them in its"
"bulk as well. The feeble microscopical equilibrium is due to the complex electrical relation existing among the three components of the c athodic system: the substrate (Ni, Ag, Pt, Au), the co-deposition Pd/D and the solution. First 15This perspective must be considered only a conjecture sustained only by some experimental evidences of piezonuclear reactions in solids, which will be presented soon. Of course one might wave the evidence that macroscopic outcomes, in terms of transmutations, ionizing"
"radiation, extra heat, were only be obtained where Deuterium was used and that, viceversa, when Hydrogen was used the results were much less evide nt. However, Deuterium cold fusion explains only very hardly the anomalous outcomes of LENR and CMNS experiments. Conversely, always remaining of a conjectural ground, it is possible to hypothesize that, once the microscopical spacetime has been deformed thanks to presence of a heavy nucleus, like Pd, lighter nuclides may fall into the deformation and take part"
"in the non Minkowskian nuclear reaction. In this non Minkowskian sense Deuterium contributes with one neutron more than Hydrogen. 16A lead in the se nse that deeper investigation, experimental, theoretical and phenomenological will have to be carried on from this point.   of all this dynamically unstable relation is established by the electric potential differences which can be synoptically represented by the Fermi level and the redox potential of the three components and second by the presence of Deuterium"
"and its continuous supply. Deuterium moves within Palladium and this exposes the latter to local gradient of pres- sure. Along with it, the flow of  an increasing current alters the electric equilibrium and generate local forces and hence pressures. Besides, one might think that if the electrolytic current is not stable but presents brief and maybe small variations (small spikes), they produce gradients of magnetic field which, on their side, induce gradients of pressure. We reckon that, from the picture"
"presented above, it is fairly reasonable to hypothesize that within the electrolytic technique with Pd/D co-deposition there exist local experi- mental  conditions compatible with those found in piezonuclear reaction experiments where cavitation took place. As a bubble is local frail inhomogeneity within a liquid which can be squeezed and deflatedby squeezing it by ultrasounds, the locally frail structure of Pd/D co-deposition presents local inhomogeneities or hollows (e.g. gradients of the density of Pd"
"and/or D atoms) whose sudden and violentcollapse can be induced by bringing the systems to a far from equilibrium condition (electric or magnetic field, p eriodical increase of current, continuous flow of Deuterium with the co-deposited layer.) As Iron atoms (not light elements) are entrapped in the interface gas/liquid of bubbles and are launched against each other during the collapse and forced in a smaller and smaller volume of spacetime until the energy threshold is reached and overcome in a precise"
"interval of time, Palladium atoms might endure similar processes as hollows in Pd/D co-deposition are made collapse. One more mental picture can be added to t he scenario. Let’s imagine that these conditions are established in one point of the Pd/D co-deposition, and that these processes take place there. These processes in one point might trigger other similar processes in points of Pd/D not too far from it. It would be a bit as if a balanced seesaw were outweighed on one side (external cause like current"
"or fields) and, as it touches the ground, it triggered a slight explosion, which would thrust this part upwards and the opposite one downwards which, in turn,  would trigger a second explosion, and so on. Many an evidence has been collected by different experimental techniques compatible with processes or NAE that are randomly distributed all over Palladium (hot spots, concen- trated evidences of charged particles, concentrated presence of anomalous transmutation products). Control experiments with Copper"
"instead of Palladium are in favor of these hypotheses since Copper does not absorb Deuterium and hence no suitable structures 17Although one may think that these  gradients of magnetic field are small, they have to be imagined applied to microscopical regions 18We remind that in our phenomenological model the generic bubble deflates while being squeezed by a shockwave. In other words it is not treated as mean to compress the gas contained in it in order to reach hot fusion conditions. 19The rapidity and"
"force of the collapse will be two of the many parameters that will have to be estimates, however the violence here refers to the microscopical region where pressure  is applied 20There is no need for imagination, at least for the processes, since this is what comes out from all of the evidences.   with hollows or gradients of density are formed []. Besides, when bulk Palladium is used instead of Pd/D co-deposition, some evidences are obtained but far less than with the latter []. In [] cracks are indicated"
"as ”...the only environments obviously common to all successful experiments...”. Always in [] it is said that Palladium expands as it  is loaded with Deuterium and cr acks of different dimensions form during this process. Cracks are said to be present in Pd/D co-depositions or Palladium black. Some questions are raised as to how cracks are involved in the cold fusion process, or as to how cracks operate to allow Coulomb barrier penetration, or as to how dimensions of cracks influences the formation of a"
"NAE. Eventually, cracks are said to be good candidates to be a NAE. According to our theory and hence according to our hypotheses, the NAEs that form in our experiments a nd in all of the LENR/CMNS experiments do not trigger well known nuclear processes and we believe that this is a fact more than corroborated by loads of anomalous evidences. Moreover, our theory predicts, although at an initial level, that these new nuclear processes cannot be account for by the well known laws of (nuclear) physics."
"Conversely, since local Lorentz invariance breakdown and spacetime deformation take place, all the concepts like Coulomb barrier, that belong to a flat spacetime, may not be sui table to describe both qualitatively and quantitatively these new processes. Nuclear spacetime deformation which, according to us is the heart of these phenomena, has been discovered to be brought about by pressure and an energy releasing mechanism (cavita- tion in our experiments) which succeed in creating those conditions"
"mentioned above that are the overcoming of the 367.5 GeV energy threshold and the release of this energy in a precise interval of time. Under this point of view, cracks are the equivalen t of bubbles. However, the important part is how rapidly and forcibly these cracks (hollows) are made collapse [, ] and in this sense the dimensions of the crack play their role. Before concluding, we would like to point out one more thing. We said that, high atomic mass nuclides contribute to facilitate the overcoming of"
"the energy threshold when they are forced in a smaller and smaller region of spacetime. This qualitative picture may induce to think that starting from Palladium, one should obtain heavier  nuclei like in a sort of new type nuclear fusion. If it were like this, the evidences would be against. In [] it is re- ported of transmutations whose products were Aluminium, Magnesium, Chlorine, Silicon which are all lighter nuclides than Palladium. Since these transmutations are thought to be brought about by"
"spacetime deformation, it is possible that a heavy nuclide be ripped apart into lighter nuclides by tidal forces i.e., in more picturesque way, as an astronaut would be as he were falling into a bl ackhole.
