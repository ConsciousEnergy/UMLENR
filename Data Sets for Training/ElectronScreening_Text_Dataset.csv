"online 12 January 2023 Editor: D.F. Geesaman The electron screening effect was studied in the 1H(7Li,α)4He, 1H(19F,αγ)16O and 2H(19F,p)20F nuclear reactions on two different hydrogen-containing palladium foils. In one of the targets we did not detect a large enhancement of the cross section due to electron screening, and in the second one we measured a high electron screening potential for all three reactions, up to an order of magnitude above the theoretical models. Contrary to the predictions given by the"

"could be the case if monocrystalline targets were used, but most experiments measuring high electron screening (including ours) were conducted on polycrystalline targets. Understanding electron screening is very important in nucleosynthesis calculations. Precise reaction rates should be known at very low energies where screening effects cannot be neglected and for a proper application, electron screening must be included in most calculations related to the nucleosynthesis of elements. However, this is"
"currently impossible because we simply do not know enough about this effect. Furthermore, it is believed that electron screening in stellar plasmas differs from the laboratory screening because the atoms in the stellar interiors are in most cases in highly stripped states and the nuclei are immersed in a sea of almost free electrons, which tend to cluster closer to the nucleus than in atoms.

However, this new nuclear reaction was only observed for a single beam energy and in a single target. Therefore, to confirm that our approach to electron screening is correct, new studies are required. Lately, our group was focusing on studying"

The 19F ion beam with currents of about 0.5 μA was used to study the 19F+p reaction in an energy region between 6.410 and 6.819 MeV and the 19F+d reaction in an energy region between 3.089 and 9.200 MeV. The numbers of incident ions were deduced by measuring the charge collected on the electrically isolated target chamber. In order to correct the

Two 2 × 2cm palladium targets were used. The first target was Chempur’s 100 μm thick soft Pd foil and the second one was a 100 μm thick cold rolled Pd foil produced according to our specifications at Zlatarna Celje. It was cold rolled from a thickness of about 2.5 mm to 0.1 mm. This foil was much less flexible than Chempur’s one."
"The purities of both foils were above 99.9%. In order to prepare the targets for electron screening studies, both foils were first loaded and unloaded with hydrogen several times. The cycling was performed by leaving the palladium in hydrogen gas at the pressure of 1bar and temperature of 24 ◦C for 24 hours and then heating it to 300 ◦C. After that, the Pd foils were once again loaded, but this time the foils were left in a gas mixture containing 85% deuterium and 15% hydrogen, again at the pressure of 1bar"
"and a temperature of 24 ◦ C for 24 hours. In order to effectively prevent substantial heating of the targets during the experiment, prepared palladium foils were mounted on a massive copper holder. Targets were positioned in a high vacuum chamber perpendicularly to the beam direction. During the experiment, we monitored hydrogen and deuterium loss in both targets by repeatedly measuring yields at the beam energies of 2.071, 6.665 and 7.671 MeV for the 7 Li+p, 19F+p and 19F+d reactions, respectively, before"

However, our targets showed loss of deuterium (and hydrogen, consequentially) during all measurements in the experiment with the 19F+d reaction due to higher beam intensities and longer measurements. In order to correct for the deuterium loss, we normalized the detected yields for a given beam energy to the average of the"

Note that the 2.071 MeV 7Li ion beam is fully stopped in palladium at the depth of 1.92 μm and the 9.200 MeV 19F ion beam is fully stopped at the depth of 2.06 μm []. Since we do not expect the two hydrogen isotopes to behave differently when loaded simultaneously in palladium foils, we assumed a uniform depth distribution for protons, too. Total hydrogen/deuterium concentration"
"in the targets could be precisely determined gravimetrically by subtracting the weight of the empty foil from the weight of the filled one. Stoichiometries deduced in this way agreed very well with the NRA measurements. Although, both of our targets had uniform H(D) distribution and were loaded with H(D) at the same time in the same gas chamber, in the soft palladium foil, maximum concentrations of 70% of H(D) per metallic atom were achieved. This is consistent with the limit of hydrogen absorption at"

"Discussion The first goal of this study was to fabricate at least two palladium targets with different electron screening and then to understand which parameters of those targets differ. Thus, one of our targets was a soft Pd foil in which we measured low screening, and the second one was a cold rolled (hard) foil where we measured a high screening potential that is an order of magnitude above the adiabatic model calculation. In normal Pd, the absorbed H(D) atoms occupy octahedral interstitial sites of the"
"face-centred cubic (fcc) lattice []. H(D) in palladium lattice can also get trapped at grain boundaries, dislocations and voids []. It is well known that the cold rolling process increases the number of grain boundary defects, but when the foil is annealed the number of these defects is reduced. As it was discussed already in Ref. [], a pos-                                         sible explanation for this different behaviour of the two foils could be that the screening potential is increased by increasing"
"the number of grain boundary defects into which hydrogen and deuterium atoms could be trapped. As we have shown in Ref. [], hydrogen on regular interstitial sites in the fcc lattice did not produce a large electron screening effect. Only when the H(D) atoms are pulled away from their fcc equilibrium positions a large screening effect occurred. At octahedral interstitial sites the electron density is the lowest in the fcc lattice, while when hydrogen nuclei are pulled away from these sites, they are placed"
"on the path of valence electrons. These then determine the screening potential. To substantiate this claim and to elucidate positions of hydrogen isotopes in palladium lattice and local electronic structure around H(D), we measured the Knight shift by employing the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique [].

The KH values for the hard Pd foil, however, differ from the theoretical value, that is approximately -14 ppm for PdH0.47. This discrepancy shows that the majority of hydrogen atoms are not located at"
"regular octahedral interstitial sites in the hard Pd foil, but mainly at crystal lattice defects. It is well known that the cold rolling process creates a large number of grain boundary defects into which hydrogen and deuterium atoms could be trapped, but when the foil is annealed the number of these defects is reduced. The fact that our hard Pd foil was cold rolled, indicates that an increased number of defects can play an important role in the screening mechanism. Namely, the difference of about 30 ppm"
"points to a substantially higher density of electronic states at the position of the protons in the hard Pd foil. One of the main goals of the present study was also to investigate the dependence of electron screening on the atomic number Z of the projectile. So, the reactions with 7Li and 19F ion beams ( Z =3 and 9) were studied. From Table 1 one can find that this dependence seems to be closer to quadratic than linear one expected from Ref. []. The quadratic dependence coincides with the Z- dependence of"
"the ionization energy of single electron ions []. Additionally, to check the isotope effect of electron screening, we studied two reactions induced with the 19F ion beam - 19F+p and 19 F+d. As can be seen from Table 1 no such dependence was found. This is in agreement with the theory []. Since the results critically depend on the stopping powers, we checked whether SRIM [] used experimental data or calculated stopping powers and differences between the two. For the Li beam, measurements exist in Pd and"
"cover a range of energies from about 5MeV down to 1MeV []. The agreement with calculations is good and the differences between the measured and the calculated stopping powers are less than 2.5%. For the F beam in Pd measurements exist in a narrow energy region from 80 keV to 400 keV [], but the neighbouring carbon and oxygen cover the energies from 1MeV to 5MeV [] and from 1.5 MeV to 4MeV [], respectively. The differences between the measured and calculated stopping powers are never larger than 15%. There"
"are many more measurements of stopping powers in neighbouring Ag metal. Also, in this metal the vast majority of measurements agrees with theory by better than 15% []. From this it is clear that the obtained enhancement factors cannot be explained by the potential use of wrong stopping powers. Moreover, the different hydrogen content in different Pd targets changes the stopping powers by less than 1%. Therefore, the use of wrong stopping powers would not change our electron screening potentials by more than"
"1%. Conclusions We studied the electron screening effect in the 1 H(7 Li,α)4 He, 1 H(19F,αγ)16O and 2 H(19 F,p)20 F nuclear reactions on two different hydrogen containing palladium foils. In one of our targets we detected electron screening that is in an agreement with the adiabatic limit, and in the second one we measured a high electron screening potentials for all three reactions, that are an order of magnitude above the theoretical model. In order to understand the reason behind this different behaviour"
"of the two foils, we measured the Knight’s shift by employing the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique. The results showed that the target preparation is only an indirect cause of the high screening potentials obtained experimentally. The target preparation influences the position of the target nucleus in the crystal lattice of the host metal and so the electron densities around the implanted target nucleus. Different electron densities are the direct cause for different screening potentials, which is"
"confirmed by measuring very different Knight shifts in our targets. This indicates that contrary to the predictions given by the available theory, the screening effect is not linked to the static electron densities around interacting nuclei and that a new approach has to be applied. We also found that the dependence of electron screening on the atomic number Z of the projectile seems to be closer to quadratic than linear one expected from the theory []. We confirmed that there is no isotope dependence of"
"the screening potential. In order to better understand how electron screening is linked to the host’s crystal lattice structures and the location of the target nuclei in the metallic lattice and how electron densities affect it, further studies are required. Since in the stellar plasma, electron densities around the target nucleus are much higher than the ones existing in materials available in the lab, knowing very well the dependence of electron screening on electron densities is crucial in order to draw"
"the parallel with the stellar plasma. It would be advisable to study screening energies with heavier target nuclei implanted in the crystal lattice, such as He or Li. Besides, the same investigations should be repeated with different host materials and additional quantitative methods, such as neutron and X-ray diffraction, should be applied to investigate the positions of target nuclei in the lattice.
