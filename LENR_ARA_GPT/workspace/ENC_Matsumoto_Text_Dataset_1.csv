"nuclear collapses ve oen take place by the gravitational rce aer stars consume their el. Since the electromagnetic rce is about 40 orders stronger than the gravitational rce, it should be easy to induce similar nuclear collapses by the elecomagnetic rce in laboratory. But we never knew until now how to do that.  Recently, the author discovered a nuclear collapse which was induced by the electromagnetic rce in laboratory, during studying the mechanisms of so-called ""Cold Fusion (CF)"" phenomena. Several kinds"
"of nuclear reaction which were directly induced by the electromagnetic rce, called ""Electro-Nuclear Reaction (R),"" were und so far to occur in a special state of hydrogen clusters, called ""itonic clusters,"" or ""micro Ball Lightning (BL)."" The nuclear collapse was one of the most remarkable reactions among Es, called ""Electro-Nuclear Collapse (ENC)."" Furthermore, very amazingly, completely broken materials by ENC were und to be regenerated again to thin tubes and lms of conventional elements such as carbon,"
"oxygen and iron. The latter process was called ""Eleco-Nuclear Regeneration (ENG).""  This book collects reviews and original papers related to ENRs (published or unpublished) between 1989 - 1999, which were mainly written by the author. Readers could llow steps to the discove of ENC and understd that ENC related phenomena could take place widely in the natural environment as well as in other technical elds.

"Fleischmann and S. Pons published the so-called Cold Fusion (CF) phenomena. They urged that more output energy than input one was generated during electrolyzing heavy water with a palladium rod electrode (J. Electroanal. Chem., Vol. 261, p. 30I (1989)). At the same time, S. Jones et al. also published CF phenomena with a similar electrolysis method, but associated with no remaable output energy (Natu Vol. 388, No. 27, p. 737 (1989)). Since the issue itself was ve scientifically important, in addition to the"

A big controvey occurred between many researchers with positive and negative opinions, and continued r sevel yea.

Almost all researche failed in their attempts and denied the reality of CF. However, a very small numr of"

The discoveries were more rigidly coned in later experiments of (b), (c) and (d). Then the author's study moved to an advanced electrolysis method of (b). Here it was und that dischges took an important le to induce signicant ENRs. Next, the author caied out the USO method of (c) by using thin wire electdes with a hi"
"current densi. Here special hydrogen cluste were visibly observed shining on the surfaces of the electrodes. They were called itonic clusters or mico Ball Lightning (BL). Many beautil pictures which made sure the occurrence of ENC were obtained. It was also found that thin tus and lms consisting of mainly a carbon element were regenerated om ENC, called Eleco-Nuclear Regeneration (ENG). The AC discharge method of (d) was in pallel investigated. Lastly, natural phenomena as well as other technical fields"
"were examined to search r ENRs. It was strongly suested that ENRs could very oen take place ywhere in the natural environment as well in other technical elds.          a. Study of Original Electrolysis Method  When the original electrolysis method was published, a big scientic consion occurred. There were two main reasons r that. The rst was the low reprucibili of the exriment. The second was that no theory existed for the mhisms of the CF phenomena. The rst was simply overcome as the number of the"
"experiments increased. But the second continued r almost seven years. During the riod,,e conventional sion reactions of producing He-3, tritium and neutron om two deuterons were a priori sumed and the experimental data were never discuss from a new viewpoint.  The basic idea of The Nattoh Model was in the author's head in March in 1989, soon aer the publication of CF (4 - 8). The Model predicted that a special cluster of hydrogen could be rmed in a palladium rod, but not in lattice. The hydrogen cluster was"
"sumed to be songly compressed to induce a new sion reaction of producing He-4 fm two deuterons (4 6). Furthermore, a new particle, iton, was predicted to be etted in order to suppress the emission of a 2. 5 MeV neutron om a compound nucleus of He-4 ( I 0, 11). A concept of chain reactions with itonic clusters was also inoduced to explain the pduction of a high excess ener (12). Although these earlier ideas were a little modified as the study progressed, many important parts of The Model were still alive and"
"rather ce more solidied. The Model conibut very much r the author to search r new phenomena. The contents of The Model were coming much richer than the original one, by adding many importt discoveries. The mechisms of CF was reviewed in Re (1) and some comments were added in Ref. (2).  The Nattoh Model had so dierent concepts om all of other researchers' models that it continued to be iored even in the communi of CF researchers. However, readers will soon find out that my searchers beg to accept the basic"
"ide of The Nattoh Model. The exrimental data, escially new and curious ones, coned the proprie of The Mel.  On the other hand, the author ercaied out expements of the original eltrolysis method with a palladium d, as my other researchers did. But he employed a dierent detection method of nucle emulsion. Later a unique method of USO was employ as well. Many importt cts which were never expected by everyone at the publication of CF were discoved by the author. There were two main reasons: the nuclear emulsion"
"technique was the most sensitive method and the USO method with in wire electres had the highest cuent density.  The first discove was a ct that CF was feasible not only with heavy water, but also with ordinary water (9). The author rst attempted the original electrolysis method with a palladium rod. In order to detect gma rays om nuclear reactions (4 - 6), a Ge(Li) detector of a high ener resolution was used. It was a challenge to examine whether ordiny water was available as an electrolyte solution or"
"not. This should have sounded t reckless to other resechers, but he had a strong condence which was based on The Nattoh Model. In general, The Mel accepted no dierence between heavy and light water r rming hydrogen clusters. Extordinarily eneetic X-rays with a continuous sctm were successlly detected, although no gamma rays caused directly by nucle reactions were obtained. It was rigidly conrmed in later USO experiments that the emission of the high energy X-rays was a phenomenon closely related to CF (59)."
"Sondly a similar elecolysis exriment was performed with a palladium rod, but with heavy water. Here nuclear emulsions were used to catch a new particle, iton, which was theoretically p dicted by The Nattoh Model (11). Ve soon aer a prediction paper of Ref. (11) was submitt, exrimental data r the particles we obtained (10). The editor of the joual rommended the author to chge the order of the two papers, because the eoretical prediction could be more easily accepted by readers. The author agreed with the"
"prosal, but in real, the theoretical prediction preceded the observation. As the study pgressed, it was und that the number of the itons were too small. Comments were descrid to this point (2).  Thirdly, microscopic featus of palladium rods which were used r the above electlysis exriments with light and heavy water were examined (17). Here a scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used. The Nattoh Model predicted that nuclear reactions causing CF took place not in lattice, but in small vact spaces such as"
"grain undaries, dects d interfaces.  The SEM pictures clely showed the growth of spots in which CF reactions occurred. Almost all researchers lieved that nuclear reactions should have taken place in lattice so that the author's signment was not accepted at the time. Later, this fact w rigidly conrmed as the study proessed, escially during USD. But not a small number of resechers still had the wrong idea of in-lattice model.  Fourthly, a eat discove was made during searching r traces on nuclear emulsions"
"(18). It w microscopic explosions of clusters. In Re (18), the microscopic explosions were assigned to be caused by a nuclear collapse of guard-neutrons. The term of ""gvity decay"" was called aer the gravitational collapse in the universe. Ler, many traces of micscopic explosions were obtained in exriments with a higher cuent density, and it was consolidated that the microscopic explosions were induced by Electro-Nucle Collapse (ENC) of itonic clusters with a large number of atoms (2). Rerence (18) reported"
"other types of explosion pructs like films. They were not assigned in Re (18) but at the present time, explained well by ElectrNuclear Regeneration (ENG) which was confirmed in later studies (2). Thin films of mainly a carbon element were regenerated om ENC. The ENG process was not recognid during the study of the original elecolysis method of (a), but made cle in later experiments of the USD method of (c) which had a high current density to promote the ENG process.  Fihly, Electro-Nuclear Transmutation"
"(ENT) was discovered by an element analysis of a palladium rod which was used r an electrolysis experiment by the the original method of (a). Since many resechers were nrowly cussed to search r light elements such helium and tritium during an early period of the CF study, it was unexpected that heavy elements were newly produced during electrolysis (19, 57). Rerence (19) was the t obseation of ENT during the original electrolysis experiment. Elements were analyzed with an energy disrsive X-ray analyzer"
"(EDX) sociated with SEM. Another element analysis was performed by a neuon activation method with a nuclear reactor of Kyoto University (57). The discovery of ENT enhanced the importce of CF except the heat production. Feasible schemes of ENT were pposed by The Nattoh Model (53). The Model predicted that sequential captures of hydrogen nuclei (protons) or electrons could take place with host elements as well hydrogen itself in itonic clusters (I, 2). Then the idea was far beyond the common sense of nuclear"
"physics so that nobody believed it. However the idea now gan to be accepted by several searchers who were caring out exriments of ENT, although they referred none of the author's papers (74).  Sixthly, strange energetic waves were observed by carel seching on the same nucle emulsions (15, 23). The contrast of traces was not so enough to examine their details. In latest USD experiments, micro Ball Lightning (BL) were easily made, from which energetic rotational waves were observed to be emitted, just like"
"microscopic toadoes (79, 80). It could be suggested that there might have been some relationship between the ely waves and rotational ones. The prorty of the waves still remained to be resolved in ture.  Seventhly, other curious traces which could be caused by ENC of some clusters were also observed on the same nuclear emulsion (24). There were several kinds of tces, among of which some simil traces were already reported in a previous paper (18). The others were then signed to ENC products of multiple"
"neutron nuclei (tiny neutron sta), which could be rmed from a heavy nucleus of palladium by the compression with surrounding hydrogen cluste. This assiment was made mo clear in later studies. A curious string like tce shown in Fig. 6f in Ref. (24) was und a thin carbon tu which was regenerated om ENC. Although Fig. 9 showed one nucleus of pallium which was covered by itonic hydrogen clusters, a very large number of palladium nuclei were involved in real. The reon why the tiny neutron star could exist r a"
"moment was explained elsewhere by The Nattoh Model (2).  In the preding study, my important discoveries were successlly made. They were done by setting nuclear emulsion outside the electrolysis cell. Nuclear emulsion was the most sensitive among devices which were employed to catch reaction products, and brought us a plenty of reliable inrmations. However, the ahor was unsatisfied in the experimental arrgement, because more direct infoations were required in order to exine the mechanisms of the CF"
"phenomena.  In the next study, the author employed a thin foil of palladium as a cathode, which was horizontally plac (33). Hydrogen atoms were charged om the upper surface of the foil which was contacted with an electrolyte solution, and the other surface was in air. Reaction products which emerged om the il were directly caught with an assembly of nucle emulsions which were placed under the rear surce. My importt traces were obtained with the ngement of the palladium foil.  First, simultaneous explosions"
"of ENC were clearly observed (21, 25, 32). Figure 4 in Re (25) showed that assembly of hydrogen clusters were emitted om the rear surface of the foil and that at least three clusters ong them simultaneously induced explosions of ENC. The explosions seemed to have occued soon aer the assembly was sepated into individual clusters. In Ref. (25), there were no explanation about curious thin lms, although the author was aware to those extraordina thicess. The films had spherical and ciular shapes, and the latter"
"was made a break up of the rm. Later studies confirmed that the lms were regenerated during explosions of ENC (2, 70, 71). e, a tiny black hole should be certainly rmed by ENC.  Secondly, curious mesh like traces were also observed on the same nuclear emulsions (33). Figure 3 in Ref. (33) showed traces of microscopic explosions which were assiated with mesh like traces. The Nattoh Model predicted that a special state of hydrogen clusters, called itonic cluste, could be rmed in the palladium metal (1, 2)."
"Many electrons in the itonic clusters were assumed to be interconnected each oer. The mesh like traces clely indicated the ation of those itonic elecons. My traces with only broken meshes were also shown in Fig. 4 in Ref. (33). They were fading during the flight.  Thirdly, anomalous and long tube like traces were obseed on the se nuclear emulsions, as shown in Fig. 7 in Ref. (33). The assignment was not clear at that time, but later studies conrmed that the tube like traces were caused by the itonic"
"clusters themselves. The itonic clusters showed curious behavior ve similar to that of natural Ball Lightning (BL).  Fourthly, multibody ssion reactions were discovered (26). They were found by star like traces which were recorded on the same nuclear emulsions. There were various branches r the multibody ssion reactions, which probably depended on the excitation ener of a compound nucleus. The details of the ssion agments were not yet investigated.          b. Study of Advanced Electrolysis Method  In 1991,"
"the group of R. L. Mills et al. proposed an advanced elecolysis method of(b) by using a nickel plate as a cathode (Fusion Technology, Vol. 20, p. 65 (1991)). Excess heat was geneted as soon as the current began to ow. The author also examined the mechanisms of the advanced electrolysis method of(b) for about ten months in 1992, based on The Nattoh Model (1, 2). As resulted, it was made obvious that The Nattoh Model was applicable not only to the system of palladium and heavy water, but also to that of"
"nickel and ordina water. This study, in spite of the short period, was a very importt step throughout the whole study, because the author was aware to the importance of discharge effects to obtain more signicant Rs.  The author carried out an exriment similar to the advanced electrolysis method of(b), in which a cathode of a thin nickel plate was horizontally placed in contact with a solution of ordinary water (34). Nuclear emulsions were also set under the plate in air, while the electrolysis was employed"
"on the upper side of the plate in the solution. Many traces of explosive reactions were successlly recorded on the nuclear emulsions. They were liable evidences r the prediction by The Nattoh Model that itonic cluste could be rmed between the nickel plate and the solution, because nickel had a low permeability of hydrogen. The rmation of tiny white holes was rst proposed in Ref. (34).  A similar experiment was repeated again with a strong condence of obtaining a high excess heat, but the result was"
"unexpectedly an explosion soon aer the current started to ow. The author assumed on the second oughts that the current density was not always unirm over the whole plate and that small local discharges between the electrodes could induce ENRs to lead the explosion. However the explosion was not considered negatively at all, but could rather suggest the occurrence of more signicant ENRs.          c. Study of Underwater Spark Discharge (USD) Method  The author was aware to the importance of electrical"
"discharges r inducing signict nuclear reactions during the study of the advanced electrolysis method of (b). He repeated discharge experiments many times between I 992 - 1999, enhancing dischge eects (30, 35, 36, 39, 42, 45, 47 - 52, 54, 56, 59, 60, 63 - 73). Many importt discoveries were newly made or became more rigidly conrm.  First, one-point CF experiment was carried out, in which a thin pin of platinum and a copper plate were used r electrodes. The pin was vertically located over the plate with a"
"small gap in a solution of ordinary wer and a pulsed current was discharged between them (30, 35).  Itonic hydrogen clusters with large dimensions were obtained, but bken in parts. Collapse products of the itonic clusters were also deposited on the surface of the copr plate: string d lm like pructs. Although no element alysis was made at that time, they we assigned as avi day pructs of the itonic clusters. This assignment was found right as the study proessed.  Secondly, similar experiments of the pulsed"
"discharge were performed, in which two thin wis of palladium were located with a right angle in a solution of ordina water. A small gap was provided between the wires as well. Nuclear emulsions were set outside an acrylic window of a cell. Many curious tces like rings were recorded on the nucle emulsions. The traces were assigned to be caused by itonic clusters (50, 51). It w concluded that small itonic clusters generated during USO were ve similar to BL which was oen observed in the natural environment."
"The clusters were later called micro BL. Here, the author rived at a new conclusion of that CF d BL, both of which were so curious and still remained unsolved, could be bed on the same physical principle: they both were itonic clusters.  Thirdly, other curious traces were obtained on the same nuclear emulsions during USO exriments (49, 51). They suggested the genetion of microbacteria during USO (49, 51). Some traces recorded on the nucle emulsions looked like a protope of microbacteria. Since the number of"
"e aces was not sufcient, more studies with high voltage discharges were plaed in tu. But they have not yet been done.  Fourthly, a new kind of the eltrical current was discovered (54, 56). The author was early aware to a ct that thin copper wires of leading cords became dark aer electrolysis or dischaes, although they were wholly coated by resin materials. The color was darker as the position was closer to a connecting point with an electrode. It w found that the phenomenon w caus by transport of itonic"
"clusters through wis. Since itonic clusters could exist r a moment as stable bodies and have negative charges, they could be driven through the leading wires by the electrical potential to make some kind of elecical cu ent, which could be completely dierent om the conventional current. So the heavy ow was called the second electrical cuent. The cuent was simultaously a magnetic ow, because the itonic cluster had a magnetic moment (2).  Fihly, a new discove was made r sparks (51, 59). In April in 1994, the"
"author was making eorts to increase the current density during USO with a DC mode, by using thin wire electrodes of cadmium. Then, he observed a little spk shining on a bottom tip of a cathode which was coved with a pinched gion. The pinch eect worked well over about 50 V, in which gas evolution w stopped and the cuent was songly suppressed as well. He examined the detailed property of the curious sparks. As resulted, it was und that the spark was consisted of many micscopic spks which were consistent with"
"the itonic clusters or micro BL. During eltlysis by the original electrolysis method of (a), itonic clusters should have been rmed in a palladium metal, but none of them could have been seen. However, during the USO experiments, itonic clusters appear shining on the surface of the cadmi metal by two reasons. The cuent density was high so that the dimension of the itonic cluster bame sufciently large. Secondly, cadmium had a low hydrogen permeabili so the itonic clusters were rmed on e sue of the electrode."
"When the itonic clusters broke up, X-ys with high ener up to about 150 keV were emitted (59). Furtheore thin lm like pducts were le ne the bottom tip of the cathode aer the discharges (59). It was also und in later studies that the film pructs we regenerated by ENC (2). The USO method was very easy d eective to genete micro BL so that it w oen employed in later studies to examine their details.  Sixthly, a gat discove related to nuclear collapse w made during USO experiments (63 - 66, 68 - 73). When itonic"
"clusters of lead and cadmium were made with a high cuent density, conventional elements such cbon were regenerated om their ENC as thin tube d lm like products. The phenomena clearly indicat that some kind of nucle transmutation took place d that at least they were caused by nuclear reactions. But no nuclear reactions of a normal level could have explained the phenomena at all. One example was that if the nuclei of lead and cadmium were assumed to have a structure of many clusters of cbon nuclei d others,"
"they could be recombined to thin tubes d lms aer break up. But this hypothesis seemed insuicient. On the other hand, The Nattoh Model pposed the foation of tiny black d white holes which intduced the regeneration of elements. Since the rmation of black holes were observed in the universe, This hypoesis seemed more natural th the above-mentioned nuclear reactions. This process w called Electro-Nuclear Regenetion (ENG). Similar products of thin films or tubes we ve oen observed in elier exriments (18, 35),"
"but then the mechisms were le unsolved. The detailed study with USO enabled us to conrm the occurrence of ENG. This was ve amazing such that noby ever expected.  Lastly, the details of micro BL were studied by the USO meth (67, 77 - 79). Micro BL could be easily generated during USO and driven on the surface of a copper plate by electrical elds. It sometimes le zigzag traces of one soke writing and suddenly disappeared to transrm to thin carbon films. Alteatively, micro BL could induce eption of rotational"
"waves, just like microscopic toadoes. Anyway, it would be reasonable to consider that micro BL could ve easily generated during other CF experiments and that it caused the CF phenomena ve complicated Many researchers we luctant to recoize the rmation of micro BL during their CF experiments, because the natul BL was too curious to be seriously treated with. Rather, it would be expected that the articial BL will rapidly proess the study of the natural BL.          d. Study of AC Dcharge Method  In 1992, I."
"Yukimura brought the author AC discharge meth of (d) to ask whether it could be related to CF. There, thick rods of titanium we used r elecodes and AC discharges with a high current we continuously applied in a solution of ordina water (26, 31). Curious phenomena such as luminescence were observed on the surfaces of the electrodes.  The author also examined the AC discharge method of (d) with him between 1992 - 1994. They und that spas repeated lightning or disappearing, haonized with the uctuation of AC of"
"50 Hz. They used only titanium r the AC discharge experiments, but it was und later that titanium was special among metals (palladium, platinum, nickel, cadmium, tungsten, copper, aluminum, iron, indium, lead and etc.), which were used during the USO experiments mentioned in Sec. 2. c. With all the other metals except titanium, small sparks rst appeared on the surface of a cathode in a low voltage region, and then on an anode with a slightly weak brightness (might be lightning) as the voltage increased. On"
"the other hand, with titanium, similar sparks rst appeared on the anode, and then on the cathode as the voltage increased. They had an idea of that the mechisms r the formation of sparks with titanium should be dierent from that with the other metals. But no more detailed study was made yet.  They also obseed anomalous multiplication of electrical current during AC dischges with titanium rods (37). The current sharply increased near a voltage, at which sparks began to apar. When a spark le the electrode, a"
"small white area was le on the surface of the titanium rods. Since e aa was a naked metal surface and had a low electrical resistance, the current remarkably increased. However, the feasibili of multiplication still remained, because break up of sparks (itonic clusters) containing titanium could somewhat contribute to additional current.  In 1994, their cooperive study ended by a ason why they had dierent ideas about the sparks each other.          e. Potential Application of Electro-Nuclear Reaction (ENR)"
"The USO meth mentioned in Sec. 2. c was a revolutiona technique to induce ENRs. Here no electrolysis process which took a long time for chging hydrogen was always required. Since the method was very easy, many applications could proposed as follow.  The first pposal was ener production as originally proposed by CF. The author prosed the asibili of sea water r energy production (9) and simultaneously the generation of ordina water om sea was also proposed (14).  The second prosal was nuclear incineration of"
"radioactive wastes which were produced om reprocessing plants of snt nuclear els (2). There were several kinds of ENRs which could be potentially applied r nuclear incineration. Among them, the most eective could be a method based on ENC. Here the rate of incineration could expected to be extremely high, because a large bulk of radioactive mateals could instantaneously collapse. A simple sprayer was also proposed r the nuclear incineration of radioactive materials, which were widely distributed in the"
"natural environment (62). A more challenging method was proposed for a direct nuclear incineration of spent el rods (76).  The third proposal was to apply nuclear transmutation (19, 53). There were several kinds of ENRs which could contribute to nuclear tnsmutation (2). Selecting suitable processes among ENRs, valuable elements were expected to be generated om cheap elements. When ENC w employed r nuclear transmutation, cove of resources could be expected (64). For example, hardous materials such as mercury"
"and cadmium could be recovered to new elements (64). Alteively, ENC could provide a revolutiona generation method of new materials, which was completely dierent om noal methods of material pduction (65). The latter was in principle based on rearrangement of constituent elements, but the er on passing through nuclear collapse. New materials with new prorty could be made.  The fourth prosal was a driving engine by using explosions of ENC (41 ). This was excted to be a high power engine, which could be applied"
"r satellite vehicles.  The h proposal was the generation of new currents: the second eltc current (58, 60) d a magnetic one (2). They all were caused by a ow of micro BL. Fuhermore, a multiplication method of eltric current could be expected by the same principle (37).  Lastly, a X-ray laser with micro BL was proposed (81). The method could use break up of mico BL which could be stimulated under irradiation of incident X-rays.  All of those proposals were just ideas so that detailed study should be promoted"
"in ture as soon as possible.          f. Electro-Nuclear Collapse in Natural and Other Technical Fields  It would be reasonable to consider that ENRs could be easily induced in natural and other technical elds (2). The dimension of itonic cluster which sensitively dended on the cuent density was very widely rged from a microscopic dimension of several atoms to a macroscopic one of a bulk, say about I 00 cm. There were many reports in natural and other technical elds, in which very strange phenomena were"
"observed, but le unsolved. Since ENRs were so difcult to understd, nody might have been aware to the occurrence of ENRs including ENC, even if they in real witnessed strange phenomena. However, ENRs could be easily found out if researchers would carelly search for them om a new viewpoint of ENRs.  The author searched r ENRs in some natural and technical fields. It was prosed that there were high asibili of that ENRs could be closely related to many sange phenomena (2). Here natural d other technical elds in"
"which ENRs could be involved will described, in addition to Ref. (2).  The t was discharges and electrolysis, from which ENRs were discoved. They could widely occur in natural and technical elds. One typical example in Nature was a thunderstorm which was a large scale of electrical discharges. Ball Lighing of a diameter up to about I 00 cm were observed, associated with thunderstorms. We now knew that micro BL could be easily generated during USDs in laborato. The conclusion would be straight rward, i.e.,"
"BL in the natural environment could be itonic clusters with a large diameter which was made during thunderstorms with an eremely high cuent (2, 82). The were many reports about mysterious circles which were oen made in rms. The author also observed several mysterious circles in Sapporo in September in 1996, which were generated aer heavy thunderstos (83). The rmation was repeated three times at the same location r ve days. It would be very feasible that mysterious circles could be made by BL in laboratory."
"Other typical example in technical elds was electric welding (83). Radiation damage to materials as well as human beings were oen repoed with electric welding. But no one was aware to ENRs during the process. If strange phenomena associated with electric welding were studied carelly, ENRs could be easily und. Since curious vact spots were observed during laser welding, ENRs could be induced even with laser welding.  The second example was physical compression which could induce ENRs to cause earthquakes (2,"
"61, 67, 83). Rocks which were strongly compressed by stress underground could potentially induce ENRs to collapse. During the earthquakes, itonic clte were obseed on nuclear emulsions (62, 67). During the Hanshin-Awaji Eahquakes, strange phenomena such as fi balls were observed by many people bere heavy seismic vibration curred. Fi balls could be well explained by the emission of itonic clusters which could be made by collapse of underground rocks by physical compression.  The third example was physical"
"friction which could potentially induce ENRs. One typical example was shooting stars. Recently, shooting sts were carelly obseed with cosmic dusts om the Eagle. Here curious weakly shining traces which looked like long tubes were observed aer bright light completely disappeed. The formation of the long tus remained mysterious. If ENC was assumed to occur with shooting stars, long tube like products should be certnly le.  The urth exple was exposu with radiations such as gamma rays and laser (83). When a"
"material was irradiated with intensive ionizing s, atoms of the material could be ionized and at the same time, my electrons could be emitted. Those pticles could recombine to induce EN in a situation with a high dose rate.  The fih example was nuclear explosio of ssion or fusion reactions (83). It would be amazing that when a nuclear bomb exploded, itonic clusters could be generated. The author recently proposed a hypothesis of ENRs during fission reactions. Here, a hi rate of the fission reactions were"
"required to induce ENRs, as the case of gamma rays irdiation. Furthermore, the author predicted on the same principle that ENRs could induced at an initial excursion of neutron ux during e JCO accident in Jap (82, 83).  The sixth example w dust plasma, in which tiny particles of dust could be itonic clusters by capturing many electrons in plasma The itonic dust clusters should show ve curious behavior like BL. Although an explosion of the dust particles were treated as an evaporation, it would be highly"
"asible that the explosion could be caused by ENC. The proof could be easily made by nding out carbon materials of ENG products.  The lt example was biology. It would be a little amazing that in a biological tissue, ENRs could occur to induce nuclear transmutation (2).  Searches r ENRs in the natural as well as other thnical fields just gan om the new viewpoint of ENRs. Cal observation should be required evewhere for curious phenomena in the natural and technical elds.          Summary          In the"
"preceding section, steps to the discove of ENC have been describ by  llowing the reviews and original pe. Here, we will summize the discoveri related to ENC which were made tween 1989 d 1999.  Many imrtt discoveries related to ENC were made by the author during the riod. They are summarized as llow,          Discovery of itonic clusters  A special state of hydrogen clusters were discovered and they were called itonic clusters:          itonic cluste were generated during all of CF related exrimen: the"

Discovery of ElectrNuclr Rcons (ENRs) in itonic clusters  New kinds of nuclear reaction were discover in itonic clusters and they were called Electro-Nuclear Rctions (ENRs):          a new fusion reaction of prucing He-4 om two deuterons was discovered to occur in itonic deuteron clusters as a key reaction to"

"201  Mechanisms of Cold Fusion : Comprehensive Explanations by The Nattoh Model Takaaki Matsumoto (Received August 21, 1995)  Abstract  The phenomena of cold fusion seem to be very complicated; inconsistent data between the production rates of heat, neutrons, tritiums and heliums. Our thoughts need to drastically change in order to appropriately understand the mechanisms of cold fusion. Here, a review is descri.bed for the Nattoh model, that has been developed extensively to provide comprehensive"
"explanations for the mechanisms of cold fusion. Important experimental ndings that prove the model are described. Furthermore several subjects including impacts on other elds are also discussed.  Keywords  Nattoh model, hydrogen-catalyzed fusion reaction, iton, gravity-decay, multiple-neutrons, tiny blackhole, tiny whitehole          Introduction  Since Pons and Fleischmann and Jones et al. independently published works on cold fusion (1, 2), many experiments have been carried out over the world to verify"
"whether the fusion reactions can really take place in a metal at room temperature (3 -6). Since deuterium gas is charged into the metal, the conventional D-D fusion reactions were initially expected to occur in the metal by any unknown mechanisms, that are familiar in the high temperature plasma physics, are written as follows,          D+Dr    »^He+n                  V       >T+p    (2)          •He+r   (3)  Here the reactions of Eqs. (1) and (2) take place with the approximately equal probability, but the"
"third reaction of Eq. (3) is about 107 times less than the formers. Therefore the particles of neutrons, tritiums, and heliums were enthusiastically searched to explain anomalous heat production in metal. Although the data obtained so far show deviations between the studying groups, they are gradually converging. It has at  Department of Nuclear Engineering, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060 JAPAN  least been made clear that the phenomena of cold fusion is too complicated to be explained by the conventional"
"D-D fusion reactions by the following reasons.          The excess heat production was accurately measured by many researchers (3-6). Those amounts are extraordinarily large so that they cannot be explained by the conventional chemical reactions.          The neutron production was observed by many researchers (3-6). The measured neutron energy is veried to be about 2.5 MeV that is consistent with that produced by Eq. (1) (2). However, the production rate of the neutrons is 1012 to 1013 times less than that"
"was calculated from the excess heat production based on Eqs. (1) and (2).          The tritium production was also measured by many researchers (3-6). The production rate of the tritiums is 104 to 108 times higher than that of the neutrons (7). Partially because the tritium measurement is more difcult, there exist large discre^- ancies between the experimental data. This rather suggests that there might be a systematical reason.          The helium production was also measured by the small number of groups"
"(8). Unexpectedly, instead of 3He, shown by Eq. (2), a lot of 4He was produced. Helium -4 might be produced by Eq. (3), but the reaction is associated with the gamma ray. The amount of 4He seems to roughly correspond to the production rate of the excess heat so that if the reaction of Eq. (3) predominantly occurred, the energetic gamma rays should be intensely emitted. However, such gamma rays could not be observed experimentally.          The energy spectrum of the charged particles, such as protons and"
"heliums, was measured by the few groups (9). The charged particles showed the complicated spectrum that cannot be expected by Eqs. (1) and (2).          Ordinary water is available to cold fusion to produce excess heat (10-13). This is surprising because the cross section of the H-H fusion reaction is about 1012 times less than that of the D-D reaction, and is extremely important for industrial applications of cold fusion.          Many extraordinary phenomena associated with cold fusion were reported"
"(14-23). For example, microsparks were observed on the metal surface(22), and strange particles and waves were recorded on the nuclear emulsions (14-21). Recently, a metal hydride of palladium showed the good conductivity in a high hydrogen ratio (23).  In order to explain the mechanisms of cold fusion, many hypothetical models were proposed (3-6). Some are based on conventional reactions and others on new reactions, whether they are chemical or nuder reactions. A good model should comprehensively explain"
"all the phenomena of cold fusion mentioned above. Almost all models seem to be only trying to enhance the conventional D-D fusion reactions or the somewhat modied reactions in the metal in order to explain the extraordinary phenomena of (a) and (b). Even if they could succeed, they should answer much more difcult questions such as (c) to (g)_ It seems that slightly modied conventional theories cannot comprehensively explain these complicated phenomena. Now our thoughts on cold fusion should be changed"
"drastically. How can we arrive at the right answer?  By seeing the sun rise from the east and set in the west, the Ptolemaican theory simply states that the sun moves around the earth. It is somewhat inevitable to us that we have the Ptolemaican theory for any new phenomena because we have to protect ourselves from them. By changing our way of thinking from the Ptolemaican to the Copernican theories, we are now going to understand not only the behaviors of the planets but also the origin of the universe."
"For cold fusion, on the other hand, we are now in the era of the Ptolemaican theory. Since the deuterium gas is charged into the metal, we are convinced of the conventional D-D fusion reactions, whichever one is for or against cold fusion. We should change our way of thinking to the Copernican theory in which our view point also moves around hydrogen atoms.  The author earlier proposed the Nattoh model (""nattoh"" means fermented soybeans in Japanese) that introduces a new ""hydrogen-catalyzed"" fusion"
"reaction(24-26). The new reaction occurs in hydrogen-clusters that are formed in tiny spaces in the metal, such as grain-boundaries, defects and interfaces. The hydrogen-clusters can be compressed by themselves in a highly pressurized state of the hydrogen atoms, in which new particles ""itons"" are produced. Energetic hydrogen atoms that can instantaneously be emitted during the hydrogen-catalyzed fusion reaction make additional fusion reactions. This means that the chain-reactions of hydrogen can be"
"maintained in metal. The sequential reactions of the hydrogen-catalyzed fusion reaction are primary for cold fusion, especially for the Pons-Fleischmann method. Furthermore, since the hydrogen -cluster can contain many hydrogens, possibly many millions, many strange reactions are associated with the primary reactions : productions of heavy elements and multiple -neutron nuclei, formations of tiny black and white holes and so on. Readers will easily understand that cold fusion is a small scale simulation of"
"the events that occur in cold stars far away in the universe. By accepting the Copernican theory for cold fusion, we can microscopically arrive at the same position as the origin of the universe.  This paper describes comprehensive explanations by the Nattoh model for the mechanisms of cold fusion, especially Pons-Fleischmann type experiments and important experimental evidences that verify such explanations.          Mechanisms of Cold Fusion  Let us briey consider a ssion reactor. There the principle is"
"well known : ssion reactions of uranium and/or plutonium are maintained by chain-reactions of neutrons. However, this answer is only 50% correct. There are various additional reactions associated with the primary ssion reactions: various neutron-induced reactions, betadecays of ssion products and so on. If detectors are located near the ssion reactor core, various kinds of radiations could be measured.  The situation of cold fusion might be similar to the ssion reactor. The phenomena of cold fusion seems to"
"be very complicated. But unexpectedly the principle might be simple. When the reactions are appropriately arranged in order, the mechanisms of cold fusion can be well understood.  The mechanisms of cold fusion are summarized in Fig. 1. The processes of cold fusion can be classied into two categories : primary and associated reactions. The primary reactions are the hydrogen-catalyzed fusion reactions that contain both of the intra- and inter-cluster reactions. The former means the new hydrogen-catalyzed"
"fusion reactions and the latter the chain-reactions of the hydrogen atoms, respectively. The associated reactions involve the conventional D-D fusion reactions and the other branches of the many-body fusion reactions induced in the hydrogen-clusters. Further reactions are mainly induced by the production of the multiple-neutrons. The rate of the reactions shown in Fig. 1 depends on experimental conditions, especially the current density and the pressure of hydrogen. As the current density or the hydrogen"
"pressure increase, the reactions shown in the lower part of the gure can be highly enhanced.          1 Primary Reactions          Hydrogen-Catalyzed Fusion Reaction (24, 25)  The primary reactions of cold fusion are the hydrogen-catalyzed fusion reactions that occur in the hydrogen-cluster. The hydrogens that diuse from the metal surface are trapped inside and outside the lattice in the metal. The former hydrogens can take no fusion reactions because they are located in specied positions between the metal"
"nuclei and are too distant to fuse each other. The latter hydrogens are mainly trapped in grain-boundaries to form hydrogen-clusters. The hydrogen-clusters are so pressurized by the overpotential of the electrolysis that they can induce the new ""hydrogen- catalyzed"" fusion reactions by self-compression. The number of hydrogen atoms contained in the cluster is plural, possibly many millions, so that there are a lot of variations for the hydrogen-catalyzed fusion reactions. This fact makes cold fusion burn in"
"various manners. The most probable among them are the fusion reactions between two hydrogens under the many-body interactions for heavy water as follows,  (4)  (5)  (6)  for the emission of the single iton i1, and for the emission of the double iton i2, where 2n and 4n are multiple-neutrons of di- and quad-neutrons, respectively. Here the number of the electrons and hydrogens that participated in the left side of the equations are very large, so other variations are possible, but with the less probability."
"D+2e+D  D+2e+D  ^n + ia + d  ^H + ia + ^n  ^n + ia + d  ^H + ia + ^n  (7)  (7)  The production of the new particle ""itons"" is clearly related to the hydrogen-catalyzed fusion reactions, in that t.he compression of the hydrogen-cluster can be explained by two steps : (1) eective mass of the electrons increases by following the hydrogens to initially shrink the hydrogen-cluster and (2) in the shrunken hydrogen-cluster, the hydrogen nuclei are depolarized to form the itons that further compress the cluster. In"
"the rst process, the electrons take an important role. If additional electrons are induced by owing electrical current or discharging, the compression is more progressed. The new particle ""itons"" might be consisted of electrons, positrons and neutrinos. The itons cover up the surface of the product particles such as the multiple-neutrons. Much more electrons than positrons are involved in the itons so that the itonic particles have highly negative charges. When the hydrogen-cluster shrinks into the"
"extremely compressed state, the electrons might be localyzed and/or degenerated so that the itons have the mesh structure. On the contrary, the iton takes the de-ionization eects during passing through a material and nally decays to a pair of an electron and a positron.  In the compressed hydrogen-cluster (""itonic particles""), the distances between the nuclei are so short that other fusion reactions can easily take place. For example, more two-body fusion reactions can simultaneously occur within the same"
"hydrogencluster. Here the fusion products such as the quad-neutrons can be emitted, combined each other with the itonic networks. Alternatively, many-body fusion reactions such as three and four body-fusion ones also can occur in the compressed hydrogen-cluster. Those reactions provide not only heavy elements but also heavy mutiple-neutrons. They can be classied into the associated reactions, as mentioned before.  There might be an alternative scinario in the second proccess. When the hydrogencluster is"
"compressed, only a mesh structure of the electrons might be formed in stead of the formation of the itonic mesh. Even here, the same particles are produced,          2D+e+D 'He+e+D  (4a)          ^'H+D   (5a)          2D+2e+D-'n+D    (7a)          Chain-Reactions of Hydrogens  The hydrogen-catalyzed fusion reactions mentioned above emit energetic hydrogens that can make additional fusion reactions in other hydrogen-clusters. These intercluster reactions are the chain-reactions of the hydrogens that can be"
"maintained under the appropriate condition in the metal (25). This is similar to the neutron chain-reactions in a ssion reactor. For cold fusion, the hydrogen-clusters are fuels, instead of uranium and plutonium, and the hydrogens are catalyst particles, instead of the neutrons. There are two modes of the burning with the hydrogen chain-reactions : direct and indirect. The former consists of the sequential fusion reactions that occur within the hydrogen-cluster under the slowing down process of the"
"energetic hydrogens, such that   the burning is local and bursts. The latter, on the other hand, occurs between the hydrogen-clusters that are located comparably distant each other. Those mode can burn continuously and widely over the metal.  The indirect mode was discussed in detail in the previous paper (25), in that the time behavior of the free hydrogens and hydrogen-clusters are separatively written by two diusion equations, respectively, as follows,          ^ op^, t) D'2 - 1Nhr+( c(N) fu + ^p-tp )N<+"

Equations (9) and (10) are non-linear due to the cross term of the ux < of the free hydrogen and the number density of the hydrogenclusters N. The stationary solution can be obtained for a special case with the at distribution of the hydrogens and hydrogen-clusters. The critical condition is written as follows,    where  kf  where  kf          k       + l  dtp ~dtp          k       + l"

In order to ignite or keep the chain-reactions, it is essential to provide the dense distribution of the hydrogen-clusters in the metal. This means that there exists the"
"critical concentration of the hydrogens contained in the metal. On the contrary, when a crack and/or spot that quickly reduce the hydrogen concentration are produced, the critical condition is broken. The power drop for a simple case of the symmetrical division can be written as follows (25),  P=QeWa/uN*^s'^A'nAn' f dr          nn'     ^Vr                          X       <Pont + y R°p2 Cl -     1       (15)                  I       X ~rLff/r>Nn    f          2 Associated Reactions  There are several"
"reactions that are associated with the primary fusion reactions. Since many hydrogens are involved during the hydrogen-catalyzed fusion reaction, very signicant reactions that cannot be induced by the high temperature plasma at all are possible.          The conventional D-D fusion reactions of Eqs. (1) to (3) are associated to emit 2.5 MeV neutrons, tritiums and so on. These reactions are induced when the energetic hydrogens that are produced by the hydrogen-catalyzed fusion reactions of Eqs. (5) and (7)"
"bombard near hydrogens in the metal. The conventional fusion reactions certainly take place, but as secondary processes, and it is wrong to consider that they are the primary processes. The rate of the conventional reactions is approximately 1012 times less than that of the hydrogen-catalyzed fusion reactions, that is one of the main sources of the excess heat. This is a reason why the production rate of the neutron is extremely less than that calculated from the excess heat. On the other hand, the tritiums"
"also should almost be equally produced as the 2.5 MeV neutrons. As discussed in (c) of Sec. 1, the experimental data show that the production rate of the tritiums is 10' to 108 times higher than that of the neutrons. This discrepancy will be discussed later.  There is a special case, in which the chain-reaction of the hydrogen-catalyzed fusion reaction does not sufciently take place but that of the conventioanl fusion reactions is locally ignited in a compressed gas of hydrogen. This case might sometimes"
"occur in an experiment with the zero or low current density. Here the amount of tritiums and 2.5 MeV neutrons are much larger than that of helium-4, so that the conventional fusion reaction looks like the primary process.          Elements can newly be produced during cold fusion. There are three ways of the element production : transmutation from the nucleus of the host metal and electrolyte, many-body fusion reactions of the hydrogens and man-body ssion reaction. The rst can take place when the hydrogen-"
"cluster surrounds the nucleus of the host metal and electrolyte and is compressed asymmetrically : one or more electrons, hydrogens and oxygens are rst captured by the located nucleus. Here. the product elements are often heavy and are distributed near the original nucleus. For example, elements of '°Ca and 115In can be produced from the electrolyte K and host metal Pd, respectively,                   ”K+p    ‘’“Ca   (16)                  ■*K+“0  »’""Co-z^ ’Te    (17)  EC    (1II0O8PPdd ) +6D-  (1II0O8PPdd )"
"+6D-  211s1n  211s1n  (18)  (18)  On the other hand, the electron capture can less contribute to the nuclear transmutation, because the product often returns back to the original nucleus by the beta decay.  Secondly, comparatively light elements also can be produced by the many-body fusion reactions of the hrogens in the compressed hydrogen-clusters. For example,                  3D      >®Li    09)                  4D 8Be  2 4He   (20)          5D 10B  (21)  These elements are sequentially distributed from"
"lithium to around iron. As the burning is more violent, heavier elements can be produced. Thirdly, the many-body fusion reaction also can contribute to the nuclear transmutation, as will be discussed in (d).  It is remarkable that the nuclear transmutation occurs without radiation. All of the reactions from (16) to (21) take place in the itonic particle so that excited energy of the compound nucleus is transferred to the vibrating motion of the itonic mesh. Furthermore it is important to keep in mind that"
"among the nuclear transmutation reactions there are reactions with the negative Q value. This is a case of that much heavier elements such as Fe are produced when the hydrogen capture proceeds.          Multiple-neutron nuclei can be produced during cold fusion. The di-and quadneutrons can be produced by the primary processes of Eqs. (4) and (7). Furthermore, the intermediate multiple-neutrons such as 6n and 8n can be produced by the manybody fusion reactions as follows,                  3D+3e+D • ^n+is+d"
"(22)          4D+4e+D-8n+i4+d (23)  Heavy multiple-neutrons, more than 30 neutrons, can be produced by compressing the nuclei of the electrolyte and host metal surrounded by the hydrogens, as follows,          AK+Ae+D-An+iA+d (24)                  ''Pd+Ae+D       ►■'n + iA+d     (25)  Those multiple-neutrons are covered up by the itonic mesh so that they cannot scatter out individual neutrons. Rather they are metastable for a moment and shrink to nally undergo the gravity decay.          Nuclear reactions"
"are caused by the bombardment between cold fusion product particles such as the multiple-neutrons and the nuclei of the surrounding materials. When the multiple-neutron enter the nucleus, the exciting energy of the compound nucleus is expected to be so large that a nuclear reaction with several energetic fragments can be induced. This is the many-body ssion reaction. The reaction is also possible with light nuclei such as silver that can induce no ssion reaction with the ordinary neutron. And heavy elements"
"also can be produced as ssion products, that might be somewhat radioactive. The many-body ssion reaction is observed like a star on nuclear emulsions.          ""Gravity-decay"" (referred to distinguish the microscopic phenomena from the universal ""gravitational collapse"") can be caused by the multiple-neutron. When the multiple-neutron is produced, it is covered up with the itonic mesh by that the constituent neutrons cannot be scattered out. Rather by the compression force of the itonic mesh, the multiple-"
"neutron is completely distroyed and shrinks to an extremely tiny particle. Finally the multiple-neutron transforms to a tiny blackhole. The tiny blackhole instantaneously evaporates by emitting radiations and/or extremely tiny particles. On the other hand, the materials absorbed in the tiny balckhole are violently destroyed and are emitted from a whitehole through a wormhole that connects both of the holes.  It seems difcult to accept that the blackhole can be generated in the cell, because it is usually"
"considered that the blackhole in the universe needs a mass 10 times over than that of the sun. The fact is contrary. Since the gravitational force is employed to compress and completely destroy an assembly of neutrons, the extremely heavy mass is required. The gravitational force is the weakest among four naturally existing forces. However, if the electromagnetic force is eectively employed, it is easier to generate a tiny blackhole, since the electromagnetic force is about 40 orders stronger than the"
"gravitational force. Here the tiny blackhole is not black in the accurate meaning, but is so light that cannot prevent the light from escaping from the hole.          3 Surface Reactions  Unlike in the metal, the situations become more complicated on the surface: (a) chemical reactions deposit materials such as the electrolyte, (b) overpotential highly compresses the hydrogen-clusters and (c) local discharge enhances the hydrogen-catalyzed fusion reactions. Among them, the chemical reactions are"
"conventional.          Surface Reactions  There is a variation in cold fusion that predominates on the surface of the metal. This is signicant for the metal with low hydrogen permeability, such as nickel. Here the hydrogens cannot penetrate deeply so that the hydrogen concentration of the surface increases. And the hydrogens that can freely move around on the metal surface gather in tiny pits to form large hydrogen-clusters. Furthermore they are intensely compressed by the overpotential of the electrolysis"
"to induce the hydrogen-catalyzed   fusion reactions. If the voltage is increased, the high compression can produce tiny black and white holes. Here the chain-reactions of the hydrogens are somewhat limited by the hydrogen leak from the surface. The sequential reactions can be maintained externally by electrolysis. Therefore the excess heat can be released as soon as the electrolysis starts. The nuclei of the host metal and electrolyte also can be burn by surrounding them with the hydrogen-clusters."
"Discharge  There are small and local discharges on the surface, even when the electrolysis is continuously maintained. They might occur around irregular points on the electrodes, such as in the pits. The discharges can accelerate the compression of the hydrogenclusters to enhance the hydrogen-catalyzed fusion reactions. Also they often burst to induce gas explosions.          4 Ordinary Water  It is very important for industrial applications that ordinary water is available to cold fusion. The mechanisms of"
"cold fusion with ordinary water is same as with heavy water, except dierent elements are produced. The cross section of the H-H fusion reaction is 1012 times lower than that of the D-D one, but it does not matter, since cold fusion is based on the dierent reactions. The most probable reactions for ordinary water that correspond to Eqs. (4) and (7) for heavy water are written as follows,          2H+e+Hr 2^e+i1 +1n      (26)          ^D + e +a       (27)          D+ii +p (28)  for the emission of the single"
"iton i1 and                  2H + 2e+ Hr     > ^n+i2 +p      (29)          ^2He + i2 + 2n  (30)  for the emission of the double iton i2. The prediction of 2He might be contradicted with the Pauli's selection rule, but allowed for a short time because two protons are compulsorily compressed by the itonic mesh. For ordinary water, proton and deuterium are the main products, that can induce the chain-reactions similar to heavy water. And instead of the quad-neutron for heavy water, the di-neutron that"
"undergoes the gravity decay is produced. The ""single"" neutron is also produced, but it might be dierent from the ordinary neutron ; the single neutron produced here is covered by the itonic mesh and collapses rapidly.  The reactions of the hydrogen-clusters from Eq. (26) to (30) produce no radioactive elements. However higher reactions generate those wastes that might be trouble some for industrial applications. For example, tritiums can be produced from three hydrogens as follows,                  3H + 2e"
"+ H     »T+ i2+p        (31)  3. Experimental Evidence  Almost all researchers who believe the conventional theory have orthodoxically been looking for experimental evidence such as the heat and the fusion products of neutrons, tritiums and heliums (3-6). However, cold fusion is based on the dierent reactions, therefore other experimental evidences should be researched. The author has been searching for such experimental evidencce by using a special technique with nuclear emulsions. Unusual particles and"
"phenomena were obtained, which clearly indicate that the mechanisms mentioned in the preceding section actually take place. In this section, the experimental evidence that was obtained mainly by the author's experiments is described.          1 Experiments  Many cold fusion experiments using the electrolysis method were carried out by the author (10, 13-22, 27, 28). Ordinary and heavy waters were used as electrolyte solutions mainly mixed with potassium carbonate and sodium chloride. Metals of palladium,"
"nickel, titanium and copper were often used as the cathode and everytime platinum was used as the anode, respectively. Two kinds of cylindrical glass cells were used for the anodes of rod and foil metals. The anode of the rod metal that were surrounded by the helical cathode of platinum was totally inserted in the electrolyte solution. Nuclear emulsions (100 µm thick MA-7B made by Fuji Film Inc.) were often used to observe emitted particles. The nuclear emulsions were set outside the glass cell. On the"
"other hand, for foil method, one of the foil surfaces was contacted with the electrolyte solution and the other with nuclear emulsions in the atmosphere. Here emitted particles from the metal foil can directly be recorded on the nuclear emulsions. Furthermore, optical and scanning electron microscopes (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were mainly used to analyze the metal structure and fusion products.          2 Hydrogen-Clusters  The hypothesis that the hydrogens form the clusters in"
the small space to induce the hydrogen-catalyzed fusion reactions is the fundamental consideration of the Nattoh model. Much experimental evidence clearly indicated that the hydrogen-clusters are really formed and that the fusion reactions really take place in the compressed clusters. The rst is the break up of the itonic hydrogen-clusters. The hydrogen-clusters that are extremely compressed are covered up by the itons. They are further compressed to form heavy multiple-neutrons by the completely
"symmetrical compression. However if it is not complete, for example, one or more fusion reactions precede in the cluster, the hydrogen-cluster might break up. Much experimental evidence suggesting the break up of the itonic hydrogen-clusters were recorded on copper metals during the discharging experiments with pin cathodes (28). Then among the broken itonic hydrogens, there were observed evidences of the fusion processes. The number of the hydrogens contained in the cluster depends on the conditions such"
"as applied voltage and current. For high voltage, such as around 100 V, the number of the contained hydrogens might be more than millions. Traces of the broken hydrogen-clusters containing many hydrogens were observed on the copper plate.  Secondly, the itonic meshes covering the hydrogen-cluster faded while passing through the material so that the linkages of the individual hydrogens become weaken and nally scatter. This is a reverse process of the compression of the hydrogen-cluster. Those evidences were"
"also observed on the back surface of the nickel thin foil, referred to the ""hydrogen-frost""Cl3). They seem to have some structure like solidied vapor.          3 Primary Fusion Products  The most probable reactions during the cold fusion are shown by Eqs. (4) to (8) for heavy water and Eqs. (26) to (30) for ordinary water. For the latter, the charged particles of the electrons, protons and deuteriums that are primary fusion products were clearly observed on the rst nuclear emulsion that was contacted with"
"the nickel cathode (13). And the di-neutrons were also measured on the nuclear emulsions and on the metal surface (13, 28). The single neutrons also underwent the gravity decays because they were covered with the itonic mesh. Those traces were separately observed on the metal surface during the one-point discharge experiments (28). For heavy water, on the other hand, no charged particles of the primary products were observed on the nuclear emulsions, because a thin protection sheet was located over the rst"
"nuclear emulsion. But Miles et al. measured a lot of 4He instad of 3He by the chemical method (8), as predicted by the Nattoh model. And the di-and quad-neutrons were successfully observed on the nulcear emulsions (A micro-explosion that was caused by the gravity decay of the quad-neutron was rst observed on August 25 in 1990 on a nuclear emulsion that was located outside of the glass cell in the experiment of palladium rod/heavy water mixed with sodium chloride, shown in Fig. 1 (21)). They are covered up"
"with the itonic meshes that are broken at the explosion of the inner multiple-neutrons. Remarkable traces indicating the explosions of the quad-neutrons associated with the break up of the itonic meshes were found (20). Furthermore a trace indicating that four fusion reactions simultaneously occur in the hydrogen-cluster was also observed (18).          4 New Particle ""Itons""  The Nattoh model predicts the production of the new particle ""itons"" during the hydrogen-catalyzed fusion reactions. The itons are"
"considered to consist of electrons, positrons and neutrinos. Since more electrons than positrons are involved, the itons are negatively charged. When the itons are produced during the compression process of the hydrogen-cluster, they are emitted to cover up the nuclei of the product particles. Figure 3 in Ref. 20 clearly shows the break ups of the itonic products, inside that the quad-neutron underwent the gravity decay. While the iton passes through the material, the electrons of the iton are torn o by a"
"de-ionization process and the iton nally decays to a pair of an electron and a positron. The sequential break ups of the network of the itonic meshes were successfully observed on the nuclear emulsions, shown in Fig. 4 in Ref. 20. And the pair productions due the itons were also recorded on the nuclear emulsions (14).          5 Chain-Reactions  The Nattoh model predicts that the chain-reactions of the hydrogens can be maintained to predominately produce the excess heat for the Pons-Fleischmann type"
"experiment. And the critical equation for the indirect mode was obtained, Eqs. (ll) to (13). It is difcult to obtain experimental evidence that directly prove the occurrence of the chain-reactions in metal. However there is data suggesting it. First, a critical value seems to exist for the atomic ratio of D/Pd, that needs to be over 0.85 in average to ignite the burning (6). Under that value, cold fusion cannot be induced at all. Second, the time behavior of the power can be well presented by Eq. (14) : it"
approaches exponentially to the constant level that can be determined by the surface condition.          6 Heavy Element Production  The EDX analyses with SEM indicated that there are heavy elements distributed in the grain-shaped defects (21). They consist of wide and continuous nuclei ranging from sodium to zinc (the EDX system is not available to lighter elements than sodium) so that they can be assigned to be produced by cold fusion processes. The Nattoh model predicts that the many-body fusion
"reactions can easily take place in the compressed hydrogen-clusters to produce the heavy elements. During the explosive cold fusion, the burning was violent so that those heavier elements could be easily produced. The neutron-induced radioactive method found that the isotope of 1151n was produced (29). This was caused by the nuclear transmutation of the host metal Pd, shown in Eq. (18). On the other hand, Bush reported that Ca was produced from K during the electrolysis of ordinary water with thin nickel"
"foil, as shown in Eq. (16) (12). Ohmori et al. reported the production of Fe on the surface of Au electrode, as shown in Eq. (17) (30). Furthermore Kucherov et al. reported the production of 23 nuclei ranging from He to Ru (31). Here the many-body ssion reaction should be involved.          7 Multiple-Neutrons  The Nattoh inodel predicts the production of the multiple-neutrons such as di- and quad-neutrons during the hydrogen-catalyzed fusion reactions. The di-and quad-neutrons are the primary products of"
"cold fusion with ordinary and heavy water, respectively. Those traces were observed on the nuclear emulsions, described in Sec. 3.3. Since many hydrogens are involved in the hydrogen-clusters, the other branches for the production of heavy multiple-neutrons might be possible. Although extremely heavy mutiple-neutrons can be trasformed to the tiny blackholes, as described in Sec. 3.9, intermediate multiple-neutrons such as 6n and 8n might be produced. They also are compressed by the itonic meshes to explode."
"Traces suggesting those explosions were found on the nuclear emulsions (17).          8 Defects in Metal  Metals that were used for the cold fusion experiments were analyzed by SEM (27). Strange defects were observed in the grain-boundaries in the metals : spot and grainshaped defects. The spot defects suggest one-dimensional burning of the cold fusion and by those sequential reactions, the grain-shaped defects are formed. They are arranged in the grain-boundaries so that these defects verify that as the"
"Nattoh model predicts, the cold fusion reactions occur not in the lattice but in the grain-boundaries in that the hydrogens can be trapped to form the hydrogen-clusters.          9 Many-Body Fission  The multiple-neutrons such as di- and quad-neutrons that are predominately emitted during cold fusion are expected to interact with nuclei in the surrounding materials to induce nuclear reactions. The compound nuclei caused by the multiple-neutrons might have a higher exciting energy than by the ordinary"
"neutron. Therefore nuclear ssion reactions with many fragments might be possible.  Stars indicating those reactions were obtained in an experiment with palladium foil and heavy water (19). The traces were recorded on the nuclear emulsions located outside the cell. They can be clearly distinguished from the stars caused by the cosmic rays. The stars suggest that the multiple-neutrons induced the many-body ssion reactions with heavy nuclei, probably silver, in the nuclear emulsions. The number of the"
"fragments was around seven or eight, and they might somewhat contain radioactive nuclei. The many-body ssion reaction should more frequently take place in the cell and somewhat contribute to the heat production and the nuclear transmutation.          10 Tiny Black and White Holes  When the nuclei of the host metal and the electrolyte are compresssed in the hydrogen-cluster, more than 100 neutron nucleus can be produced that might be transformed into a tiny black hole by the gravity decay. The extraordinary"
"trace shown in Fig. 4 in Ref. 18 indicates that a tiny black hole is produced and rolling in the neighboring materials. Due to the light mass, the tiny black hole evaporates instantaneously, as shown in Fig. 1 in Ref. 18.  The black hole is connected with a white hole from which the absorbed materials can be sprouted out. Many tiny white holes were observed in experiments with low hydrogen permeability such as nickel (13). Figures in Ref. 13 show those tiny white holes, in that the broken materials are"
"sprouting from the top of the cone. Remarkably, Fig. 7(i) in Ref. 13 shows both of the evaporation of the black hole and the sprouting of the materials from the white hole. They might have been divided while passing through a warm hole that connects the black and white holes.  It is now uncertain what materials can be sprouted from the white hole. Since the   nuclei are destroyed by the gravity decays and the broken materials pass through the worm hole of the order of 10-33 cm so that they might at least be"
"non-baryons, and consist of the tiny particles such as superstrings. The linked materials can somewhat be seen in the exit of the white holes (13). Furthermore traces suggesting that some heavy particles such as X-particle might have been emitted were observed on the nuclear emulsions (13, 20). Those pictures were published in a book (32).          11 Miscellaneous  Several extraordinary phenomena were found during cold fusion. The rst is strange microsparks that were observed on the metal surface, such as"
"titanium during the AC electrolysis experiments (22). They can be distinguished from the conventional electrical sparks. The microsparks were found to be related to the tiny black or white holes by setting the nuclear emulsions. Since the electrical charging was continuously employed, the microsparks were shining near the surface like twinkling stars. However during other experiments with the shot charging (33), the microsparks ighted 2 or 3 cm in the solution or air, like ball lightening, and nally stopped"
to explode. Furthermore strange traces of coupled rings that were suggested to be caused by the tiny ball-lightning were found on nuclear emulsions. They were symmetrically recorded on the rst and second nuclear emulsions. This means that the tiny ball-lightning hopped up and down in a small space between the rst and second nuclear emulsions. These strange behaviors can be well explained by the characteristics of the itonic hydrogen-clusters.  The second is the extraordinary conductivity that were recently
"reported by McKu- bre et al. (23). While they were measuring the electrical resistence to know the amount of hydrogens absorbed in a metal, the resistence sharply dropped. According to the Nattoh model, hydrogen-clusters that are locally compressed in small spaces in a metal such as grain-boundaries become the itonic state, that are negatively charged due to the surplus electrons and well conductive. As the hydrogen loading ratio increases, the hydrogen-clusters become densely distributed and interconnects"
"each other. Finally the rod of the metal hydride becomes wholely conductive.  The third is interference phenomena that were also observed on the nuclear emulsions located outside the cell (16). The gravitational and anti-gravitational waves were suggested for them. They should have a weak intensity but might microscopically interact with the material of the nuclear emulsions. But these should be examined in more detail.          Discussions  In the preceding sections, the mechanisms of the cold fusion were"
"explained by the Nattoh model and the experimental results that verify the explanations were shown. Here the controversial issues of the cold fusion and the other important subjects are discussed.          1 Controversial Issues  The anomalies of the cold fusion that are controversial issues can well be explained by the Nattoh model.          The primary controversy is the reproducibility of the excess heat. After cold fusion was published, many researchers tried to replicate the experiments. However very"
"few researchers succeeded. Alternatively, even in same laboratories, results depended on experimental conditions, especially used palladium rods. These are caused by the characteristics of the chain-reactions of hydrogens that is a predominate source of the excess heat for metals such as palladium with the high hydrogen permeability. The hydrogen concentration should be increased such that the critical condition of Eqs. (11) to (13) is maintained. However during the charging of hydrogens into palladium,"
"tiny cracks or pits are produced. The absorbed hydrogens rapidly leak from these place. Then the critical condition cannot be satised. Alloys of palladium with about 10% silver that protects them from cracking can improve the reproducibility of the excess heat production (6).  On the other hand, with metals such as nickel with the low hydrogen permeability, the main source of the excess heat is the surface reaction. Since the hydrogen-clusters are mainly compressed by the overpotential, the excess heat can"
"be produced as soon as the charging starts. The reproducibility can be expected to be almost 100%. In the case of the Mills type experiment, the chain-reactions of hydrogens contribute less to the heat production than in the Pons-Fleischmann type experiment, because they occur only on the surface. The other reactions such as the nuclear transmutation given by Eqs. (16) and Cl7) and the gravity decay reactions contribute more to the heat production. The contribution ratio of the reactions depends on the"
"experimental condition. The nuclear transmutation of the Ca or Fe production is predominate in the low voltage or current density. As the voltage or current density increases, the contribution by the reactions shown in the lower part in Fig. 1 becomes more.          The inconsistency between the production rates of the neutrons and the excess heat described in (b) in Sec. 1, are often controversial for heavy water. This can well be explained by the hydrogen-catalyzed fusion reactions that emit no neutrons."
"For palladium, the main source of the excess heat is the chain-reactions of the hydrogen- catalyzed fusion reactions where the new particle itons are emitted, taking away about 20 MeV from the excited •He nucleus for heavy water. The channel of the 2.5 MeV neutron emission can not be opened. Furthermore, the multiple neutron nuclei that are produced in the reactions are covered up with the itonic meshes so that the individual neutrons can not be scatted out. However, the conventional D-D fusion reaction of"
"Eq. (1) that emitts 2.5 MeV neutron takes place as a secondary process, about 106 times less than the primary hydrogen-catalyzed fusion reactions. Therefore the production rate of the 2.5 MeV neutrons is at least 106 times less than that of the excess heat.  A comment should be added for the itonic multiple neutrons. Especially the di- and quad-neutrons that are emitted during the hydrogen-catalyzed fusion reactions have the itonic mesh with heavy negative charges. They are sometimes confused with the"
"conventional neutrons or alpha particles (6). Those multiple neutrons can be detected by the conventional neutron detector such as scintillators and ionization chambers. Here, the multiple neutrons generate by the gravity decay a peak signal with a very narrow width so it could be easily distinguished from the neutron signal with careful attension. Alternatively, they also generate similar signals to alpha particles in the charged particle detectors such as surface barrier detectors. The multiple neutrons"
"can escape out of the cell or lters that can sufciently stop the alpha particles.          The inconsistency between the production rates of the tritiums and neutrons, described in (c) in Sec. 1, is an important issue for heavy water. The activity of the tritiums is observed 10• to 108 times higher than that calculated from the neutron production rate. According to the Nattoh model, •H is expected to be produced during the hydrogen-catalyzed fusion reactions for heavy water, as shown by Eq. (5). This"
"isotope undergoes the beta-decay such that the activity might be confused with that of the tritium. Although the lifetime of the 4H isotope is about 10-11 sec, it could be stable for a moment since it is covered up with the itonic mesh. Afetr the mesh fades, the beta decay instantaneously occurrs. So far the isotope of •H has not yet been observed in the author's experiments with nuclear emulsions. An assembly of the nuclear emulsions was always covered by a thin protection paper that might have prevented"
"the itonic •H from escaping. However, other researchers reported extraordinary results that suggest the production of •H. An element with a mass between 4.0026 amu of •He and 4.0282 amu of D2 was observed (34).          As described in Sec. 1, a large amount of •He instead of 3He was reported by Miles et al. (8). The production of •He would be posssible by the conventional fusion reaction shown by Eq. (3). If so, however, the intense high energy gamma rays should be associated. Rather, this fact can easily"
"be explained by the Nattoh model. The reaction shown by Eq. (4), that is the most probable branch during the hydrogen- catalyzed fusion reactions, shows the production of 'He. The di-neutrons, associated here, are covered by the itonic mesh and quickly undergo the gravity decays. If a neutron detector, such as a liquid scintillator, is located sufciently near the metal, the survival di-neutrons might be counted. Almost all of the neutron detectors are located in large moderators so that very few signals are"
"produced by the di-neutrons. Furthermore, 'He can be produced by the beta-decay of •H, as shown by Eq. (6).          The complicated spectra of the charged particles, that cannot be explained by the conventional D-D fusion reactions were reported by a thin foil experiment (9). The spectra were explained by introducing the new particle, iton (26) : therefore, the multiple neutrons such as the di-and quad-neutrons would be emitted as bare particles. It was later found that they are covered up by the itonic"
"mesh with a heavy charge (20). They might be confused with the conventional charged particles such as the deuteriums and heliums in the thin foil experiment. If these factors are enclosed, the agreement between the experiment and calculation will be better.          It is important that ordinary water is available to cold fusion. Despite that the feasibility cannot be expected by the conventional theory at all, the extraordinary signals indicating cold fusion were rst obtained with ordinary water by the"
"anthor (10). And Mills et al. reported the excess heat production with ordinary water by using a thin nickel foil (ll). The Nattoh model equally predicts the feasibility of cold fusion with ordinary water, as well as with heavy water. The excess heat production with ordinary water with the thin nickel foil is somewhat less than with heavy water in the palladium rod, because the chain-reaction of hydrogens is limitted on the surface in the former case. However, by using the surface reactions, where the"
"nuclear transmutation and the gravity decay reactions contribute to the heat production, many experimental data with the heat production were reported so far (3-6, 30). Many traces that indicate the gravity decays were observed on the nuclear emulsions (13).          Other strange phenomena observed during cold fusion can be partially explained by the Nattoh model. For example the microsparks that were observed on the metal surface can be explained by the formation of the itonic grain (22).  4. 2 Comparison"
"with the Fission Reactor  Let us briey compare cold fusion with the ssion reactor. For the ssion reactor, the primary process is the neutron-induced ssion reactions of uranium or plutonium and the power is maintained by the neutron chain-reactions. Additionally there are various reactions associated with the neutron chain-reactions: beta decays of the ssion products, Cherenkov lights by the beta decay electrons, gamma rays by (n, gamma) reactions and so on. Cold fusion resembles the ssion reactor, i.e., the"
"fundamental reactions of cold fusion are the chain-reactions of the hydrogen-catalyzed fusion reactions that are associated with various reactions. The fuel of cold fusion is the hydrogen-clusters and the hydrogens themselves are the chain-reaction particles.  The biggest dierences between them are the distance over which the chain-reaction particles can y and the multiplicity by that they are multied per reaction. The neutrons can y about 2 m in the ssion core, while the hydrogens have very short ranges in"
"metal, only several hundreds µm. And 2.5 neutrons in average are emitted per one ssion reaction of uranium or plutonium, however many energetic hydrogens per hydrogen-catalyzed fusion reaction are emitted. This is because the fuel of the hydrogenclusters consist of many hydrogens, possibly more than millions. The former fact makes cold fusion burn very locally. And the latter means that the critical condition can easily be satised for cold fusion. Furthermore cold fusion burns more variously. Although the"
"neutron ux in the nuclear reactor is limited to around 1014 n/cm2• sec, the hydrogens in the metal for cold fusion can be densely concentrated. The rates of the associated reactions during cold fusion are so high that the nuclear transmutation such as the heavy element production is more accelerated than in the ssion reactor.  It is remarkable that despite of the high production rate of the elements, there are almostly no radiation. This is due to the formation of the itonic mesh that can take away"
"excitation energy of the compund nucleus.          3 Applications  Several applications of the cold fusion technique are promising.          The energy production is the most important at the present time. There are three processes that contribute to the heat production : chain-reactions of the hydrogen- catalyzed fusion reactions, nuclear transmutation and gravity decays of the multiple neutrons. The rst is the main source of the excess heat for the Pons-Fleischmann type experiment with the palladium rod,"
"and the two Iatters for the Mills et al. type experiment with the thin nickel foil, respectively. The rst that is sustained by the chain-reaction would be good for the efciency of the heat production to input electrical power but the most difcult for the controllability of the reaction. We should be care that the nuclear transmutation of heavy elements over Fe contributes to the negative energy production. Then the efciency of the heat production could not be so improved, even if the hydrogen concentration"
"or the current density are efciently enhanced. The transforming efciency from mass to energy is the highest for the third process. For scaling up of power, it is required to achieve the high energy density. Then the method based on the third process might be superior.  For cold fusion, burst burning is easier than continuous burning. Burst burning is suitable to vehicle engines such as automobile, ships and space-crafts. It can be performed by several conditions : direct mode of the chain-reactions,"
"overcritical condition of the indirect mode or the surface reactions. The two formers are enhanced in the metal so that the damage of the materials will have unevitable problems. The last that is especially based on the gravity decays of the multiple neutrons might be more efcient to generate the propulsion power.          Nuclear transmutations also might be possible. There are three ways to obtain nuclear transmutations: production of the elements by the many-body fusion reactions, nuclear transmutation"
"from the nuclei of the host metal and the electrolyte and many-body ssion reaction. Unlike in the ssion reactor, the transmutation rate for cold fusion is very high because the hydrogen concentration is extremely higher than the neutron ux. The elements produced by the rst process continuously distribute from lithium to around iron. The second can produce elements near the host nuclei. With the third process, produced elements could be widely distributed.          Nuclear transmutation might be applied to"
nuclearly incinerate hazardous materials such as nuclear materials and radioactive wastes. The rst method of the nuclear incineration would be to use the capturing one or more protons and oxygens as shown in Eqs. (16) to (17). Cesium-137 or strontium-90 would be contained in an electrolyte solution and transuranium elements such as pultonium and neptium would be mixed in electrodes. Simultaneously they could be incinerated by the bombardment with multiple neutrons such as di-and quad-neutrons. In the former
"process, the nuclear transmutation takes place in the itonic state so that no radiation would be emitted. In the latter process, on the other hand, additional radioactive materials would be somewhat generated.          4 Safety Problems  When cold fusion is applied in the industrial scale, several safety problems should be resolved.          The rst is explosions. The explosions were often experienced during the electrolysis cold fusion. They could sometimes be hydrogen gas explosions, that can easily be"
"avoided with usual care. But even under the normal operation, the preceding explosive cold fusion reactions can easily induce the gas explosions. Here the distance between the electrodes is an important factor. If it is too short, local and small discharges can induce explosive cold fusions. More attention should be payed to controlling the cold fusion reactions as well as the chemical reactions.          Second, radioactive materials could be produced by the ssion reactions like in the ssion reactor. For"
"cold fusion, the many-body ssion reactions are induced by the multiple-neutrons such as the di-and quad-neutrons. Furthermore, the reaction of Eq. (31) generates tritium with ordinary water. They are secondary reactions so that those amounts are extremely less than the primary one. But in the industrial applications, the burn up should be so high that the amount of the radioactive materials is somewhat of be a problem. Even if so, the problems might signicantly be reduced than in the case of the ssion"
"reactor.          The third is related to the gravity decays. They newly generate tiny black and white holes that might radiate the gravitational waves and non-baryon products. These might already exist in the natural environment, since the cold fusion reactions seem to easily take place anywhere. However, they will be additionally produced with the industrial scale by the applications of cold fusion. This is similar to the problems of the radiations or radioactive materials in the ssion reactors. The"
"materials themselves might not be so hazardous but if those magnitudes are over the limit, they will become problems. The eects of those strange materials on biological tissues should be examined in detail.          5 Impacts on Other Fields  As mentioned in Sees. 2 and 3, various signicant discoveries were made during cold fusion: (1) new hydrogen-catalyzed fusion reactions associated with the itons, (2) heavy elements production by the many-body fusion reactions, (3) gravity decays to generate the tiny"
"black and white holes and so on. These discoveries in cold fusion might signicantly impact on other elds.          The iton could open new science and technology for nuclear physics and material science. Since energy concerned with nuclear physics and material science is very dierent each other, the two elds had no direct connection so far. The iton that locates signicantly near the nucleus can directly interact with the nuclei and transfer energy of the nuclei to material lattice. The spatial distribution"
"and energy of electrons in the itonic mesh should be investigated in detail.          Elementary physics might be stimulated, since the gravity decays followed by the tiny black and white holes can be produced in our laboratories. There seems to exist the critical mass that distinguishes the light multiple-neutrons such as quadneutrons from heavy ones, although the exact value is now unknown. The multipleneutrons with light mass undergo the gravity decay to explode with shock waves that were observed like"
"bubbles on the nuclear emulsions. The bubbles certainly consist of much smaller particles than quarks. Heavy multiple-neutrons, on the other hand, are transformed to tiny blackholes that evaporate to emit radiation and particles. The particles should be much smaller than the particles of the bubbles. Therefore, there might exist the level for the dimension of the particles. Furthermore the quantum-relativity theory can be examined in detail by experiments in laboratory. A simple question arises: why can the"
"signicant reactions such as the gravity decay occur in low voltage electrolysis around several 10 V, although no high energy accelerators, exixting or planning, can induce them at all. The answer is the compression eect of hydrogencluster that is essentially caused by many-body interaction. Recently, an accelerator induced cold fusion reactions by accelerating hydrogen-clusters (35).          Extraordinary phenomena were observed in the natural environment so far (36). Many of them are found to be"
"associated with the electrical discharge, but left unexplained. However they also might be made clear by similar mechanisms to cold fusion. For example, tiny ball lightenings were observed during a discharging cold fusion experiment (33).          The astrophysics might modify the senario by the discovery of the new fusion reactions. For example, the solar neutrino problems should be re-examined by inducing the new fusion reactions, because the hydrogen concentration deep in the sun is so high that new"
"fusion reactions can easily be enhanced. Alternatively, the scenario of the element production in the origin of the universe should also be modied. We can remember the events that occur in cold stars faraway in the universe. The prodution of the elements, multiple-neutrons and tiny black holes in cold fusion would correspond to the productions of white dewarves, neutron-stars and big black holes in the universe, respectively. We can say that cold fusion is a small scale simulation of the events that occur"
"in cold stars faraway in the universe. Now we can reproduce the novels of the universe in our laboratory. Therefore, the non-baryons of the gravity decay products might be found during cold fusion, that can be expected to be dark matters.          6 Summaries  In the preceding sections, the mechanisms of cold fusion have been well explained by the Nattoh model. Although important things such as the productions of 4H and non -baryon particles remain unproven, we have comprehensively but qualitatively"
"understood the extraordinary phenomena associated with cold fusion. It is characteristic that cold fusion burns in various manners depending on the conditions, because the hydrogen-cluster envolves many hydrogens. The branching ratios of the hydrogen- catalyzed fusion reactions are critical factors that are determined by the conditions of the electrolysis, the microscopic structure of the metals and so on. They will be studied quantitatively from now, but it seems very laborious because there are many"
"cases. Furthermore, the study of cold fusion will be progressed towards the high voltage and current to achieve the higher efciency of transforming mass to energy.
