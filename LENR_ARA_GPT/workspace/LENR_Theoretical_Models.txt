Summary: The Widom-Larsen Theory focuses on ultra-low momentum neutron-catalyzed nuclear reactions in metallic hydride system surfaces. The theory posits that weak interaction catalysis initially occurs when neutrons (along with neutrinos) are produced from the protons which capture "heavy" electrons. Surface electron masses are shifted upwards by localized condensed matter electromagnetic fields. Condensed matter quantum electrodynamics processes may also shift the densities of final states, allowing an appreciable production of extremely low momentum neutrons, which are thereby efficiently absorbed by nearby nuclei. No Coulomb barriers exist for the weak interaction neutron production or other resulting catalytic processes.

Main Mathematical Frameworks:

Electromagnetic Fields: The theory considers the interaction of localized condensed matter electromagnetic fields with surface electrons. Quantum Electrodynamics Processes: These processes are involved in shifting the densities of final states, leading to the production of ultra-low momentum neutrons. Weak Interaction Catalysis: This concept is central to the theory, describing the production of neutrons from protons capturing heavy electrons. Related Research Papers:

Quantum Fusion Hypothesis
The Quantum Fusion Hypothesis in the context of Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR) is explored in the following works:

A model for enhanced fusion reaction in a solid matrix of metal deuterides
Authors: K. P. Sinha, A. Meulenberg
Published: 2009-01-16
Summary: The study shows that the cross-section for fusion improves considerably if d-d pairs are located in linear chainlets or line defects in a solid matrix. The interaction with lattice vibrational modes causes localization of electron pairs on deuterons, leading to attraction of D+ D- pairs and strong screening of the nuclear repulsion. Link to paper
Catalytic mechanism of LENR in quasicrystals based on localized anharmonic vibrations and phasons
Authors: Volodymyr Dubinko, Denis Laptev, Klee Irwin
Published: 2016-08-09
Summary: The paper proposes a mechanism explaining the high catalytic activity of quasicrystals (QCs) based on unusual dynamics of atoms at special sites in QCs. Large amplitude atomic motion in localized anharmonic vibrations (LAVs) and phasons results in time-periodic driving of adjacent potential wells occupied by hydrogen ions, leading to an increase in the fusion rate.

Quantum Tunneling in Breather Nano-colliders
Authors: V. I. Dubinko
Published: 2015-03-31
Summary: The paper argues that discrete breathers (DBs) present the most natural and efficient way to produce correlation effects due to time-periodic modulation of the potential well width. This acts as breather nano-colliders (BNC) triggering LENR in solids. Tunneling probability for deuterium fusion in gap DBs is shown to increase drastically with increasing number of oscillations, resulting in the observed LENR rate at extremely low concentrations of DBs. Link to paper Note: The Quantum Fusion Hypothesis is explored through various mechanisms and models, focusing on the interaction of lattice vibrations, localized anharmonic vibrations, and quantum tunneling in enhancing nuclear fusion reactions.

They numerically monitor the condensate particle number distribution during condensate formation and derive a condition under which the unique equilibrium steady state of a dilute, weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate is given by a Gibbs-Boltzmann thermal state ofnon-interacting atoms.

Enhancement Mechanisms of Low Energy Nuclear Reactions

Authors: F. A. Gareev, I. E. Zhidkova
Published: 2005
Summary: This paper reviews possible stimulation mechanisms of LENR. It concludes that transmutation of nuclei at low energies and excess heat are possible within the framework of the universal resonance synchronization principle. The excitation and ionization of atoms may play a role as a trigger for LENR. Superlow energy of external fields may stimulate LENR.

Low energy nuclear reactions driven by discrete breathers

Authors: Vladimir Dubinko
Published: 2014
Summary: This paper proposes a new mechanism of LENR in solids based on large amplitude anharmonic lattice vibrations, known as intrinsic localized modes or discrete breathers (DBs). Gap DBs in diatomic crystals such as metal hydrides are argued to be the LENR catalyzers. The large mass difference between H or D and the metal atoms provides a gap in the phonon spectrum, resulting in extreme dynamic closing of adjacent H/D atoms required for tunneling through the nuclear Coulomb barrier.

Authors: Volodymyr Dubinko, Denis Laptev, Klee Irwin
Published: 2016-08-09
Summary: The paper proposes a mechanism explaining the high catalytic activity of quasicrystals (QCs) based on unusual dynamics of atoms at special sites in QCs, namely, localized anharmonic vibrations (LAVs) and phasons.

The interaction with lattice vibrational modes causes localization of electron pairs on deuterons, leading to attraction of D+ D- pairs and strong screening of the nuclear repulsion. Link to paper

Nucleon Pairing Theory
The Nucleon Pairing Theory explores the pairing properties of nucleonic matter, including the off-shell propagation associated with short-range and tensor correlations. Several aspects of this theory have been studied by different researchers.

Pairing in Nuclei by Wojciech Satula (link): This paper discusses simple generic aspects of nuclear pairing in a homogeneous medium and finite nuclei. It argues that low-energy nuclear structure is not sensitive enough to resolve fine details of nuclear nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction in general and pairing NN interaction in particular. This allows for regularization of the ultraviolet (high-momentum) divergences and a consistent formulation of effective superfluid local theory (PDF).

The BCS theory of q-deformed nucleon pairs - qBCS by S. Shelly Sharma, N. K. Sharma (link): This paper constructs a coherent state of q-deformed zero coupled nucleon pairs distributed in several single-particle orbits. The study of Sn isotopes reveals a well-defined universe of (G, q) values, for which qBCS converges. The pairing correlations in N nucleon system increase with increasing q (for q real) (PDF).

Nuclear pairing from chiral pion-nucleon dynamics by N. Kaiser, T. Niksic, D. Vretenar (link): This paper uses a recently improved version of the chiral nucleon-nucleon potential to calculate thepairing gap in isospin-symmetric nuclear matter. The inclusion of the two-pion exchange reduces substantially the cut-off dependence of thepairing gap (PDF).

Pairing properties of nucleonic matter employing dressed nucleons by H. Müther, W. H. Dickhoff (link): This paper presents a survey of pairing properties of nucleonic matter that includes the off-shell propagation associated with short-range and tensor correlations. A huge reduction in the strength as well as temperature and density range of-pairing is obtained for nuclear matter as compared to the standard BCS treatment (PDF).

Nucleon-pair approximation with matrix representation by Y. Lei, Y. Lu, Y. M. Zhao (link): This paper proposes an approach of the nucleon-pair approximation (NPA), in which the collective nucleon pairs are represented in terms of antisymmetric matrices. The present approach significantly simplifies the NPA computation and is formulated on the same footing with and without isospin (PDF).

Quarati (1996): This paper theoretically justifies the empirical-phenomenological quasi-deuteron photofission description within the semiclassical, intermediate statistics model. Link to paper.

Fermion transmutation - a renormalization effect in gauge theory by S. T. Tsou, H. M. Chan (2000): This paper predicts a new category of phenomena where fermions of different flavours can transmute into one another as a consequence of the 'rotating' mass matrix due to renormalization.

Quantum mechanical description of excitation energy distribution of the reaction residue in nucleon-induced inclusive one-nucleon knockout reactions by Kazuyuki Ogata (2018): This paper focuses on understanding inclusive one-nucleon knockout reactions for long-lived fission fragments (LLFPs), crucial for nuclear transmutation studies. Link to paper.

The main mathematical frameworks vary across these studies, including semiclassical models, quantum mechanical descriptions, and gauge theory.
