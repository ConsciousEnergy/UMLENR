"The collapsing bubble. In this theoretical investigation, computer simulations of chemical reactions occurring in an O2-bubble oscillating in water irradiated by an ultrasonic wave have been performed for diverse combinations of various parameters such as ultrasound frequency (20–1000 kHz), acoustic amplitude (up to 0.3 MPa), static pressure (0.03–0.3 MPa) and liquid temperature (283– 333 K).

achieved in the bubble during the strong collapse. The employed model combines the dynamic of bubble collapse in acoustical field with the chemical kinetics of single bubble. The results of the numerical simulations revealed that the main oxidant created in an O2 bubble is ^OH radical. The computer simulations clearly showed the existence of an optimum bubble temperature of about 5200 ± 200 K and pressure of about 250 ± 20 MPa. The predicted value of the bubble temperature for the production of ^OH radical

The existence of an optimum bubble temperature and pressure in collapsing bubbles results from the competitions between the reactions of production and those of consumption of ^OH radicals at high temperatures. ^ 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Among all the oxidants created in the bubble, ^OH radical is of primary interest because of its high potential of oxidation.

In the present model, the expansion of the bubble is considered as isothermal and its total compression (implosion phase) is treated as adiabatic. This assumption is very accepted as for high frequencies the lifetime of the bubble is very short and the collapse event occurs rapidly. We assume also that the vapor pressure in the"

Additionally, the importance of mass and heat transfer occur over multiple cycles of oscillation changing, in this case, the internal composition of the vapor phase.

The input parameters of the reactions system are the composition of the bubble on water vapor and oxygen at  this point, the temperature and pressure profiles in the bubble during adiabatic phase and the collapse time. All these parameters were obtained by solving the dynamics equation (Eq. (1)). As the bubble temperature increases during the adiabatic phase, the reaction system evolves and radicals start to form by"
"thermal dissociation of H2O and O2 molecules in the bubble (React ions (1) and (2) in ). Thus, the composition of the bubble for all species expected to be present (O2, H2O, ^OH, H^, O, HO2^, H2 and H2O2) was determined at any temperature during the collapse phase. The simulation of the reactions system was stopped after the end of the bubble collapse. It should be also noticed that the effect of the chemical reaction (heat of reaction) occurring in the cavity on the bubble dynamics is known to be not"

Results and discussion The present numerical simulations have been performed for ultrasound frequencies in the range of 20–1000 kHz because it is the range of frequencies commonly used in sonochemistry.

Moreover, the range itself of the ambient radius is strongly dependent on the experimentally controllable parameters, particularly on the ultrasound frequency. In this study, the ranges of ambient radius R0 for the numerical simulations are selected as function of frequency according to the experimental and theoretical results.

In , the calculated bubble radius and the temperature inside a bubble are shown as function of time during the collapse phase.

In, the mole fraction of each chemical species in the bubble is shown as function of time at around the end of the bubble collapse. The temperature profile inside the bubble is also included in this figure. In O2-satured water, the main bubble contents are oxygen and water vapor. At the final stage of the bubble collapse when the temperature and pressure inside a bubble increased drastically, more than 20% of"
"oxygen and 40% of water vapor are dissociated in the bubble and many chemical prod ucts such as H2, HO2^, H^, O and ^OH are created in the bubble. It is seen that the amount of each chemical oxidants attained their upper limit at the end of the bubble collapse (). From, it is also evident that ^OH radicals is the dominant radical species produced in the bubble and constitute alone more than 60% of the oxidants (^OH, H^, O, HO2^ and H2O2) created in the bubble. In the following Section we will, thus,"

Suslick and coworkers estimated, by kinetic measurements, a maximum bubble temperature of 5200 ± 650 K.

Thus, the optimum bubble temperature predicted in our study (5200 ± 200 K) is in excellent agreement with the experimentally estimated bubble temperatures. Additionally, Suslick and coworkersexperimentally determined an average pressure of about 150 MPa inside a single-sonoluminescing bubble. Upon stronger acoustic driving of the bubble,"
"they estimated a maximum pressure of about 370 MPa. Thus, the optimum value of pressure, 250 ± 20 MPa, predic ted in our theoretical study for oxygen bubbles is in the same order of magnitude with the experimentally estimated pressures. The observed difference may be due to the different saturating gases: O2 for our theoretical study and Ar for Suslick’s studies. Another important statement that can be made from  is that although all bubbles having temperatures at the collapse in the range of 1000–7000 K"
