"ultra-dense hydrogen clusters prove that the interatomic distance in such clusters is a few picometers, since the well-defined kinetic energy release (Coulomb repulsion energy) is many hundred eV. In the best characterized case which is ultra-dense deuterium D(-1) or d(-1), the kinetic energy given to the fragments in a cluster is normally 630 eV. This implies a D–D distance of 2.3 ± 0.1 pm (2.15 ± 0.02 pm measured in D4 clusters). A description based on theoretical work by J.E. Hirsch using only the electr"
on spins predicts that several excitation levels of spin quantum number s exist in these quantum materials. The agreement with the experimental D–D distance is excellent at 2.23 pm fors= 2. Theory is now verified by experimentally detecting states with spin values s = 1 ands=3.The D–D distance is only 0.56 pm in the lowest excitation level s= 1.

"ver, this has been more difficult to verify experimentally. Recently, progress has been made in this respect [12]. It turns out that at least two different excitation levels are normally observed in p(-1), and that the pair formation p–p is strong and gives special features in the fragmentation spectra. Each p–p pair is a boson and may replace a deuteron in chain-like cluster forms. Another property of d(-1) which is intriguing is the experimentally observed oscillation between dense deuterium D(1) and ultr"
"a-dense deuterium d(-1) [13]. The observed period of this oscillation is of the order of a few seconds. However, changes in the laser pulse-frequency do not give a simple response according to this periodicity, which indicates that the period observed is due to a beat frequency between the laser pulse-frequency and the inherent frequency of oscillation between the states D(1) and d(-1). The interconversion between these states has been studied in detail [10] and is of fundamental interest. Due to the extrem"
"ely high density of D(-1), of the order of 1029 cm-3 (140 kg cm-3) [1–6,9–11,14,15], it is believed to be very useful as target material for inertial confinement fusion (ICF) using intense pulsed lasers [1,2,15]. Experiments showing laser-induced fusion and emission of MeV particles in D(-1) are published [16–19]. The approach followed below is to find an improved theoretical description of the ultra-dense hydrogen which should agree well with the experimentally determined interatomic distance in the best s"
"tudied case D(-1). The theory that explains the experimentally determined interatomic distance further predicts that several excitation levels described by a generalized spin quantum number should exist, not only the one with the interatomic distance of 2.3 pm determined for D(-1). The theory is then verified by determining interatomic distances in two slightly different cases of ultra-dense hydrogen, corresponding to two other values of the spin quantum number. of the form given by Hirsch [26] for quantum "
"materials seems more realistic and applicable. Hirsch [26] gives three different levels of importance for the description of superconductors and similar materials. The lowest level uses the so called quantum mechanical radius rq for the electron as a measure, while the first higher uses the Bohr radius a0. The highest level uses the London penetration depth ^L and is of direct importance for the description of superconductors. Hirsch shows that the characteristic distances are related by the fine structure "
"constant ˛, in fact by ˛/2 as [26] 2^L= ^˛2^a0= ^˛2^2rq	(1) and that the energy levels corresponding to these three dimensional scales are related in steps of (2/˛). The various forms ofRM are metallic and probably also superconductive due to the large Rydberg orbits for the electrons in the condensed matter, even if this has not been proved directly yet. On the other hand, D(-1) has been shown to be superfluid [5] and appears to be superconductive since the clusters show a Meissner effect [6]. Since RM def"
"initely is based on the Bohr radius level in the description by Hirsch, it is tempting to understand the ultra-dense hydrogen as based on the lowest energy form according to Hirsch, thus on the quantum mechanical electron radius rq. This means that the interatomic distance for ordinary RM [27] d = 2.9a0l2	(2) which gives the distance H–H in H(1) as 153 pm, should be replaced by d = 2.9 rq s2	(3) for H(-1). The factor 2.9 is called the dimensional ratio and is the ratio between the interatomic distance in RM"
" and the electron orbit radius. This factor has been determined by theoretical calculations of the RM bonding [28]. It was later confirmed experimentally in RM clusters with good precision [29,30]. It varies slightly with excitation level and number of atoms in the specific cluster [30]. The spin quantum number s here replaces the orbital quantum number l in Eq. (2). Due to the small value ofrq = 0.192 pm, this description definitely matches the requirement of a small basic quantity to give the interatomic "
"distance in D(-1). This (normal) D–D distance is well established experimentally to be 2.3 ± 0.1 pm, even determined as precisely as 2.15 ± 0.02 pm in experiments on clusters D4 [4]. It is immediately seen that s=2 gives a distance of 2.23 pm, within ±3–4% from the experimental results, thus in good agreement with experiments. A recent review on RM exists [27] and thus the description of RM here will be brief. D(1) is in most respects similar to H(1) [31,32]. This means that the interatomic bonding distance"
" d1 derived from the observed kinetic energy release (KER) of 9.4 eV is close to 2.9 × 52.9 pm ≈ 153 pm [32]. (The factor 2.9 is the dimensional ratio in RM [28] and 52.9 pm is the Bohr radius.) The geometry of the orbitals at l = 1 is not strictly planar. H(1) clusters can be both planar, as for higher RM levels, and also 3D like tetrahedrons and octahedrons [31]. High precision optical spectroscopic results for H(1) also exist [33], which confirm the value of the bond distance and that several geometries "
"exist. The interconversion between D(1) and D(-1) is reported to be facile [13], with D(-1) appearing slightly lower in energy [9,13]. The same situation is also recently described for ultra-dense protium p(-1) formed from p(1) [34]. This would imply an RM type structure also for p(-1) as well as for D(-1), as suggested by Winterberg [7,8]. One possibility is that the electrons interact strongly and in this way receive a large mass as an electron structure or lattice of a large number of strongly coupled or"
" correlated electrons in the condensed material [7,8]. The experimental results on D(-1) L. Holmlid / International Journal of Mass Spectrometry xxx (2013) xxx–xxx    give proof for well-defined clusters and for a periodic (oscillatory) transformation between D(1) and D(-1) [13], which makes such a structure with strong electron interaction not easily applicable to the clusters observed.

"o D(-1). As described in Fig. 1, the structure of the ultra-dense materials D(-1) and p(-1) may appear different from the basic structure of ordinary RM (which is based on the orbiting motion of the electrons). Ordinary RM consists of planar clusters of ions with circulating Rydberg electrons giving a conduction band for the Rydberg electrons. The most stable clusters are normally planar, six-fold symmetric, with the number of atoms (ions) equal to 7, 19, 37, 61 and 91 [27]. The stability of such clusters w"

They can be formed from K, H and D atoms and contain 2, 3 or 4 atoms each exist [10,35]. This means that such ordinary RM clusters are stable, even with the electrons in almost planar Rydberg orbits with l = 3 and 4 as in the experiments cited. Small RM clusters can also form stacks of clusters, as clearly identified in the case of (H7)N (l= 1) with N = 2–17 [3"
"6]. The structure of ultra-dense materials is thus close to a stacked RM cluster case with small clusters with 2, 3 or 4 atoms stacked on top of each other, giving for example the shape in Fig. 1. However, the electron orbit size in the ultra-dense case is given by the spin s instead of the orbital angular momentum l. The stability of these materials can be understood in the same way for the ordinary RM and the ultra-dense RM cases. This means that the electrons orbit around the ions and shield them from th"

No inner electrons of course exist for hydrogen, and thus the ions are bare protons or deuterons, of very small size relative to the pm sized inter-particle distances. The pair-wise interactions between the four particles, with the interaction distances of similar size, are two repulsive terms (++ and --) and four attractive terms (+-). Thus, such a pair increases its stability with shorter distance scale as 1/r. At a typical inter"
"-particle distance of 2.3 pm, the total electrostatic energy is of the order of -1 keV thus a bound state. With different spin states for the two electrons, they may fill the same space and one of the repulsive terms (--) disappears effectively. Thus, the stability of a pair of atoms in the ultra-dense form is increased by different electron spin states. 1	e2 r= 4^ε0 Ekin where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, e the unit charge and Ekin the	242 sum kinetic energy for the two fragments (KER) from the CE.

Typical results are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. In Fig. 3, the neutral peak due to D atoms with 450 eV is mainly formed by processes of the type D+ ↔D+N where N is a number peaking at 5 thus indicating fragmentation of a D6 cluster.

These results agree well with the here predicted state with s = 2, giving a value of the D–D distance in an RM structure of d = 2.9 rq s2 = 2.23 pm. Higher precision studies on the high-charge CE of D4 clusters [4] give the D–D bond distance as 2.15 ± 0.02 pm at low (room) temperature. This agrees with the theoretical "
"value derived here within 4%. The dimensional factor d/rn = 2.9 used for RM in general [28] is known to vary with the surrounding structure, and the 4% departure here means a dimensional factor of 2.80 instead 2.9. In one high-resolution rotational spectroscopy study of large RM clusters [30], this factor was observed to vary down to 2.816 ± 0.004 from the maximum value of 2.900 ± 0.001. It is not considered unlikely that the dimensional factor in this somewhat different situation with spin instead of orbit"
"al angular momenta can be as low as 2.80 (thus a slightly shorter D–D distance). Lowest state d(s= 1) Experimental evidence for d(s= 1) exists but requires more care than the normal state s = 2. By studying the signal from a cold part of the d(-1) layer on a surface in Fig. 5, it is possible to observe faster fragments than those corresponding to s=2, with kinetic energy up to 2160 eV. This corresponds to a CE process 2 ↔ 10 with a total KERof2580eVats= 1, thus a fragmentation ofd6 clusters. The cold layer "
"is found on the back side of a metal foil where the intense laser beam has bored a hole in the metal foil. The flux leaving from the back side at a large angle from the laser beam contains such fast fragments, if the laser intensity is relatively low. At higher laser intensity, the slower TOF peaks signifying d4(s=2) and other s= 2 cluster fragments are obtained. In Fig. 5 also the s = 2 signal obtained at large laser intensity is included for comparison. It is apparent that some s = 2 contribution exists a"
"t the lower laser intensity as well, and that some s = 1 signal is formed also at the higher laser intensity. The fastest limits for the two processes are indicated in the figure. The limiting process for s= 2 described as 2 ↔ 10(+3) in Fig. 5 is a D+ ion repelled by a D52+ ion. There exist previously published results which also give good agreement with the expected energies from D(-1) in state s= 1. For example, in Ref. [3] several different time-of-flight peaks were interpreted (Table 1 in [3]). A few of"
" them could only be understood as due to 2 ↔ 1 repulsions, thus repulsions between a doubly charged ion and a singly charged ion. This may be feasible for example as d52+ ↔ d+ as concluded above. The observation of such a process implies only a lifetime on the femtosecond scale of the d5 2+ ion before the CE process is completed. However, the accumulated evidence from numerous TOF and TOF-MS studies on D(-1) by now does not support the dominating formation of such doubly charged ions in the CE process at th"
"e laser intensity used there. See for example Ref. [9], Table 1. Thus, it is likely that the peaks observed at very short TOF in the experiments in [3] should be interpreted in a different way. These short TOFs fit well into the present d(s= 1) description. The reinterpreted peaks are given in Table 2. Two of them (less common) require the ejection of d2 fragments which was not known to exist by the time of the study in Ref. [3]. However, the ejection of such fragments from d(s= 2) has been demonstrated for"
" example in Ref. [9] and should also to be possible from d(s= 1). That strong TOF peaks in [3] now can be reinterpreted as 2 ↔ 16 and 2 ↔2 for d(s = 1) supports the theoretical description given here. Further results in Ref. [3] were also interpreted as due to 2 ↔ 1 CE processes, mainly results found by TOF-MS. When the initial kinetic energy was determined to be larger than 630 eV which is the maximum for d(s = 2), it is possible that d(s= 1) is involved as well. However, the results are not so clear-cut a"
"s the TOF results described above. In Table 4 in Ref. [3], an initial kinetic energy of 800 V per deuteron was observed as the limit found at the highest laser pulse energy. This deuteron energy is too low to be easily understood as due to d(s= 1) but within the range later identified for complete fragmentation of clusters d4(s=2) (process named 8(4+ )S) giving four D fragments [4]. It should also be observed that other effects exist that may decrease the observed kinetic energy of the fragments, like rotat"
"ional excitation of d(-1) clusters which is in the multi-eV range [11]. In another study [15] higher energy peaks were observed and interpreted as due to 2 ↔ 1 CE processes. The energy observed per deuteron in the TOF-MS results was up to 1020 eV. In this experiment, a short focusing length lens was used giving considerably higher laser intensity than in the studies described just above. The interpretation used in terms of 2 ↔ 1 processes seems correct and there is no direct evidence for d(s= 1) in the TOF-"
"MS results. However, the TOF results also given in [15] gave peak energies of 1400 eV per deuteron, which agrees reasonably well with 2 ↔ 2 and 2 ↔ 3 CE processes in d(s= 1) at 1290 and 1550 eV respectively. The main explanation for this peak provided in [15] (a 3+ against 1+ charge repulsion process) is less likely in view of the new improved model for d(-1). Thus, this fast peak observed at high laser intensity is proposed to be due to d(s= 1). Normal states p(s = 2) and p(s = 3) Originally it was believe"
"d that the p–p distance in p(-1) was different from the d–d distance in d(-1). In Ref. [3], a p–p distance of 3.7 pm was determined from an experimentally observed KER of 390 eV. However, itis now found that this value is not the true value for the p–p distance. Instead, this value of 3.7 pm is probably due to a cluster break-up as p+ ↔ (p2+ - pN) which gives this approximate distance of 3.7 pm between the two centered charges from a true p–p distance of 5.0 pm corresponding to s = 3. In Figs. 6 and 7, resu"
"lts are shown that give values of p–p distances at 2.3 pm (s=2) and 5.0 pm (s = 3). In Fig. 6, the first signal rise is constant independent of the accelerating voltage over a large range. This shows that the particles giving this signal are neutral H atoms and have energy 620 eV, thus from fragmentation p+ ↔ pN+ with N of the order of 25. In Table 3, a detailed interpretation of the TOF results in Fig. 7 is given. The first rise of the signal in Fig. 7 with an initial kinetic energy of 296 ± 27 eV agrees w"

" (2013) xxx–xxx    giving an average initial kinetic energy of 138 ± 12 eV, agrees well with the value of 144 eV expected from symmetric cleavage of long clusters with s=3. Thus, the structure of p(-1) is similar to that of d(-1) but the generally observed s values are different. However, the pair formation described above which gives the apparent p–p distance of 3.7 pm gives a more complex structure, where p–p pairs that are bosons may replace d in the chain-type cluster structure. Lowest state p(s= 1) So "
"far, no experimental proof exists for the existence of p(s = 1). From the experimental results on d(s= 1) it seems likely that this p(s= 1) state could be found at slightly lower temperature than room temperature, but that the energy from the laser beam easily excites it to the p(s = 2) state. This is also a likely conclusion from the observation that the normal state of p(-1) is at s=2 and s=3, while for d(-1) only s= 2 is found as the normal state at or slightly above room temperature. The possibility of "
"induced spinflips leading to dissociation of the p–p pairs may also give more complex fragmentation modes of p(s = 1) under laser impact. Thus, p(s= 1) may be difficult to observe under the present experimental conditions of intense laser impact at or slightly above room temperature. Further studies at lower temperature should give proof for this state as well. Discussion Structure The results in previous studies and those presented here concern the structure and bonding in clusters of ultra-dense hydrogen."
" The main form of these clusters is D2N and H2N, with N an integer. The clusters can condense to form a condensed superfluid film in many experiments, still with identifiable clusters. However, on organic and inorganic polymer surfaces (glasses), such a condensed film does not form [38]. If the condensed material can form other entities like even longer clusters, bundles of chain clusters or other bulk forms [7,8] is not known at present. Thus, the structure investigated here is mainly the form of the super"
"fluid clusters D2N and H2N [5,9,37]. It is not yet known or investigated how the clusters combine to form a phase of ultra-dense hydrogen. While the structure of D2N clusters is relatively easy to derive from the experiments, with a sketch of their shape in Fig. 1, the structure of H2N is slightly more complex. Since the protons are fermions, they may form proton pairs which replace the deuterons in the structure. Thus, it may be expected that groups H3 or even H4 exist in the clusters, as also sketched for"
" D4 in Fig. 1. This is the likely reason for the special mode of fragmentation as p+ ↔ (p2+ - pN) giving the apparent distance 3.7 pm in earlier experiments, as described above. The main problem with the structure of ultra-dense hydrogen is how the electrons behave in the structure. From the good agreement between theory and experiments it is concluded that the electron spin angular momentum replaces the orbital angular momentum in the Rydberg Matter description. This replacement is not possible to understa"
"nd in the classical limit, but it should be possible to understand in a time-dependent quantum mechanical description. Thus, each hydrogen nucleus would be circled by one electron in its spin motion, and each hydrogen pair would have electrons with different spin directions forming an ordinary electron pair. It may be possible to understand the electron pairing in a time-independent picture if the electrons occupy the same orbital, centered at the center of gravity of the two hydrogen nuclei, but this pictu"
"re will not correctly show the interaction between the electrons. Further development of a full quantum description is needed. One further point to discuss is the value of the spin angular 481 momentum. Since the spin angular momentum of one electron is 482 +^/2 or -^/2 (spin up or down in a given direction) it might be	483 expected that the s values in Eq. (3) would have similar half-integer	484 values, s= +1/2 or -1/2. However, no such values have been found 485 from experiments. Instead, the integer valu"
"es of s prevail. This may	486 be due to the pairing of the electrons, giving the sum ofs=0 or 1 or	487 even a combination of these two states due to the close interaction 488 between the particles which may give a less well defined s number. 489 The integer spin values are further supported by the observation of	490 several different values for the electron motion, thus s= 1, 2 and 3	491 as described above. This may indicate coupling of a larger number 492 of spins in the clusters, giving an expanded cluste"

Thus, well-organized large clusters may not 494 exist for s = 1 in ultra-dense hydrogen.	495  Self-compression and oscillations between the states H(-1) and	497 H(1) have been reported previously [34]. The state of H(-1) formed	498 in these experiments was mainly s=2. Since each H atom has l= 1,	499 s= 1/2 in H(1) (excluding nuclear spin) and s= 2 in H(-1), a direct	500 transfer between these states seems difficult. However, an inter-	501 action between two H atom"

Alternatively, by starting with a state of two H atoms	505 in l1 = 1, s1 = 1/2 and l2 = -1, s2 = -1/2 thus total J=0 the total sys-	506 tem may switch over to s1 = 2 and s2 = -2 also withtotalJ=S= 0. The	507 initial state in this alternative form (with different directions of the	508 spins) may be due to spin-flips"

It does not seem necessary to imply a participation of the	513 nuclear spins in these processes. Such a participation will of course	514 give more degrees of freedom and make the transfer between the	515 H(1) and H(-1) states easier. Ifa difference is "

It is based on a recent theoretical development	521 by J.E. Hirsch.

When a laser pulse passes through the materials H(1) and H(-1), the pho tons may excite (displace) a few electrons so that two ions become exposed to each other.

When the CE takes place, the ions fly apart with almost all their repulsion energy as KER in the ionic fragments. Thus, it is possi ble to determine the initial repulsion energy between the ions by measuring the kinetic energy of the fragments at a large distance from the actual explosion event. Then, the distance between the ions before the break-up i.e. the bond length is found directly from"
