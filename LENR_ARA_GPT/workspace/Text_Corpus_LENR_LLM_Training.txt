Experimental Observation And A Possible Way To The Creation Of Anomalous Isotopes And Stable Superheavy Nuclei Via The Electron-Nucleus Collapse Tenth International Conference on Cold Fusion The problem of supercompression of a solid target to a collapse state is considered. The basic principles of construction and the parameters of an experimental setup ensuring such a supercompression are described. The model and method of creation and evolution of superheavy nuclear clusters with 250&lt;<i>A</i>&lt;500 and <i>A</i>&gt;3000-5000 in the controlled collapse zone and in the volume of a remote accumulating screen are discussed. The evolution of such clusters results in the synthesis of isotopes with 1&lt;<i>A</i>&lt;500 and with anomalous spatial distribution in the volume of a remote screen. These phenomena were interpreted on the basis of the idea of the formation of a self-organizing and self-supporting collapse of the electron-nucleus plasma under the action of a coherent driver up to a state close to the nuclear substance.

Investigation of the nickel-hydrogen anomalous heat effect  Experimental work was undertaken to reproduce a specific observation of the gas-phase Anomalous Heat Effect (AHE)*.  This task required the production of a quantity of heat energy by a mass of material so small that the origin of the energy cannot be attributable to a chemical process.  The gas-phase form of AHE is difficult to reproduce and hence lacks a measure of credibility.  The goal is to enhance its credibility by reproducing results first demonstrated in Japan and later reproduced in the U.S. by a solitary investigator.  The technique heated nanometer-sized Ni:Pd particles (20:1 molar ratio) embedded in micron-sized particles of an inert refractory of ZrO2. It was not within the purview of this work to investigate the physical origin of the AHE effect or speculate on its source.
High-temperature Calorimetric Measurements of Heat for Ni/H2 Exothermic Reactions J. Condensed Matter Nucl. Sci. Instrumentation developed to measure heat power from a high-temperature reactor for experimental trials lasting several weeks is being applied to gas-phase Ni/H2 LENR. We developed a reactor that can maintain and record temperatures in excess of 1200° C while monitoring pressures exceeding 7 bar. This reactor is inserted into a flowing-fluid calorimeter that allows both temperature rise and flow rate of the cooling fluid to be redundantly measured by different physical principles. A computerized data acquisition system was written to automate the collection of more than 20 physical parameters with simultaneous numerical and dual graphical displays comprising both a strip chart and complete history of key parameters. Initial studies of the absorption of light hydrogen (H2) by nickel are presented.

Cold fusion II: The Story Continues New Scientist 
Tritium and Helium Production in Palladium Electrodes and the Fugacity of Deuterium Therein  An account is given of the massive production of tritium at a Pd electrode. Production continued for ~ 750 hours after which time it was arbitrarily curtailed. Production of T was found to cease every few days but could be resuscitated by increasing the overpotential of the electrode reaction. A logarithmic relation between the rate of tritium production and the overpotential of the electrode reaction was established. The Will-Cedzynska method of examining T contamination in specimens has shown that nothing above the background of T was detected if no D2O had been electrolytically evolved on the Pd specimens concerned.

Three Dimensional Computer Simulation of an Isoperibolic Calorimeter for Cold Fusion Experiments The First Annual Conference on Cold Fusion The three dimensional heat conduction computer code HEATING5 was used to simulate the isoperibolic calorimeter being used for cold fusion experiments at Stanford University. The simulation results confirm the measured temperature distribution in the calorimeter. Computer analysis also demonstrates that temperature measurements for this particular calorimeter are independent of the heat source position in the calorimeter. A numerical procedure was developed to derive the transient behavior of the heat generation in the cold fusion cell from the transient temperature measurements. This procedure was exercised using a measured temperature pulse. The transient behavior of the power pulse was in the form of square-wave and its magnitude was slightly higher than the on-line calculation based on a steady-state approach.

The kinetic energy achieved by a deuteron accelerated from the edge to the center of an electron cluster is sufficient for the coulomb barrier to be penetrated in the traditionally known manner. The results are discussed in connection with the published experimental data concerning the impact of the electron clusters on a metal target.

Comment On Carbon Production In Deuterium-Metal Systems Tenth International Conference on Cold Fusion Several electrolysis experiments of loading deuterium into different metals foils and thin film films are described. Before and after loading the cathode surface was analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy and by Energy Dispersive Spectrometry. High magnification images of the surface of several metals were taken. A control experiment was conducted to make sure that the experimental setup is not accidentally contaminating the samples. A surprising amount of carbon was found on the cathode surface after each D loading experiment. The result is discussed in connection with other experimental results on low energy nuclear transmutations.

Limit on Fast Neutrons from DD Fusion in Deuterized Pd by Means of Ge Detector  Search for fast neutrons from the electrochemistry loaded Pd-D system at room temperature was made in order to study the possible d-d fusion there. A low-background high-resolution Ge detector surrounded by neutron scatterers was used to investigate the fast (1 ~ 5 MwC neutrons. The neutron flux was obtained by measuring rates of the gamma rays following inelastic scattering of the fast neutrons from nuclei in the scatterers. The observed spectrum shows no significantly significant excess of gamma rays above background. . . .

Distributed bosonic states and condensed matter fusion  This paper presents a theory of condensed matter fusion in crystals based on the periodic potential provided by an ordered lattice and the approximate Bose statistics obeyed by bosons on length scales associated with electrostatic interactions. The resulting nuclear interaction proceeds in a manner that approximately preserves either the initial periodicity of the lattice or the periodicity of a commensurate lattice. Reaction reversibility over timescales associated with electrostatic interaction results in condensed matter fusion being dominated by interactions in which both the products and reactants obey Bose-Einstein statistics. As a result tritium release and 3He+ production should not appear as primary fusion products.
Nuclear Fusion in a Solid via a Bose Bloch Concentrate  We present a theory of solid state fusion based on the formation of a D+ bosonic Bloch condensate within a metal deuteride. The first step towards fusion is a coalescence reaction which converts a 4-fold occupation state of zero point motion size into a state of nuclear dimensions . Reaction rates for the coalescence reaction are calculated using the Fermi Golden Rule.

Cold fusion as an interaction between ion band states Fusion Technol. A theory of solid-state fusion based on the interaction between D+ and 4He++ ion band states within a host lattice is presented. Formation of ion band-state deuterium is thermo-dynamically favored when lattice strain energy is greater than the incremental chemical potential of the band state. The key fusion step is a coalescence fluctuation that converts a twofold occupation state of electrostatic zero-point-motion size into a state of nuclear dimensions. Rates are calculated using the Fermi Golden Rule. Fusion energy is shared between band-state members and subsequently transferred to the lattice.

Deuteride-Induced Strong Force Reactions The Seventh International Conference on Cold Fusion ND band state D+ ions are treated as a sum over pairs.  The wave functions of a D+ pair is assumed to be a product of a Bloch function in lattice space times a Bloch function in separation space.  Overlap allows a strong force fusion reaction to 4He++.  A coupling between the nuclear change and the ion charge distribution in the lattice is described.  The change in ion charge distribution scatters Bloch electrons in a multistep nuclear de-excitation process.

Production of excited surface states by reactant starved electrolysis  Starved reactant electrolysis can result in co-deposition of hydrogen and a higher voltage reactant. The hydrogen has the potential to be deposited in an excited state that is delocalized and wavelike. It is suggested that this occurred in the Liaw et al. study. Evidence for cathodic overpotential electrolysis in molten hydroxide electrolyte is presented.

Overcoming the Coulomb Barrier in Cold Fusion J. Condensed Matter Nucl. Sci. Schwinger pointed out that under some circumstances the Coulomb barrier between paired charged particles is replaced by a correlation factor in a two-body wave function. This paper shows how having two deuterons bound within a common volume having a multiplicity of potential wells can lead to an energy-minimized Schwinger form of wave equation with wave function overlap. Relevance to a situation in which a small number of deuterium atoms is forced into a fully loaded palladium deuteride (PdD) host is discussed.

Are Nuclear Transmutations Observed At Low Energies Consequences Of Qed Coherence? Tenth International Conference on Cold Fusion Nuclear transmutations have been reported to occur in matrices subjected to either electrochemical or gas loading at room temperature. To overcome the difficulties of the large Coulomb repulsion among nuclei a &#947;-ray electromagnetic field appears  as a suitable agent. It is discussed whether this e.m. excitation could emerge from cold fusion processes and induce nuclear reactions through the giant resonance coupling of this e.m. field with the closed shells present in the nuclei of the matrix.

Mechanisms for heat generated during deuterium loading of alumina-based Pd nanoparticle material (PowerPoint slides) ACS National Meeting Recent studies on gas-loading of Pd nanoparticle materials have demonstrated consistent and repeatable anomalous heat production in the presence of deuterium gas [1-4]. Our group has confirmed anomalous heat production in zeolite and alumina powders containing Pd nanoparticles and found additional features. Investigations at low pressure and slow loading showed a clear association between exothermic and endothermic features and the presence of specific chemical species. These provide insight into the underlying mechanisms and the crucial question as to the origins of the anomalous heat.

A Summary of NRL Research on Anomalous Effects in Deuterated Palladium Electrochemical Systems  
The effect of microstructure on deuterium loading in palladium cathodes  The effect of micro structure on deuterium loading in palladium cathodes was investigated. Cathode micro structure is determined by thermomechanical processing that includes electrode deformation (swaging) and the annealing conditions (time and temperature). Results will be presented on the extent of deuterium loading in rod-shaped (0.4 cm in diameter and 3.5 cm long) cathodes with controlled microstructure produced at The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). Loading on NRL cathodes will be compared with that attained on commercially available electrodes routinely used at other laboratories.

Temperature Dependence of Excess Power in Both Electrolysis and Gas-loading Experiments J. Condensed Matter Nucl. Sci. The earlier data from a “Heat after Death” electrolysis experiment and from a Tsinghua University gas-loading experiment are reviewed to show that temperature dependence of excess heat in both electrolysis and gas-loading experiments supports the straight-line behaviour in the semi-logarithmic plot discovered by Storms. Additional gas-loading data in seven Pd-tubes show that excess heat is correlated to a deuterium flux as a result of the diffusion process which is implied in this temperature dependence of excess heat.

Highly significant difference of 1% level in statistics was observed between filled and emptied states in one sample among the four samples tested. This excess neutron count rate corresponds to the fusion rate of 0.8×10^ -23 fusions/deuteron pair/sec.

Continuing development of Lattice Energy Converter (LEC) technology has resulted in both experimental and theoretical advancements. Replicated experimental results and analysis for a LEC wherein a codeposited palladium-hydrogen working electrode produced spontaneous and sustained electrical energy attributed to ionizing radiation have been previously reported. Herein is reported the use of a working electrode comprised of codeposited iron-hydrogen from an aqueous solution of FeCl2 which demonstrated similar capabilities to produce spontaneous and sustained electrical energy as well as ionizing radiation. These results also have been replicated. http://ikkem.com/iccf23/PPT/Invited%20Gordon%20ICCF%2023%20LEC%20T5.MP4.

Registration of synthesis of 45Rh102 in media of excited nuclei of 28Ni58  For the purpose of searching for heavy nuclei generated in the result of low energy nuclear processes we used samples of 28Ni58 which were bombarded with 27 MeV electrons from the Resonance accelerator MI-30. The samples of nickel of 48 mm in diameter and 20 mm thick were irradiated with electrons to the level of absorbed energy of around 2.5 106 J/cm^3 which is approximately 5 times exceeds the minimum specific energy at which as it followed from the authors' theoretical model the process of generating transmuted elements will become quite noticeable.
Abnormal results of experimenting with excited substances and interpretation of the discovered effects within the frames of the model of collective interactions

Evidence-Based Public Policy for Support of Cold Fusion (LENR) Development 17th International Conference on Cold Fusion Cold fusion (LENR) has enormous potential public welfare benefit. The level of public support for its development should be determined by evidence-based policymaking. The CF/LENR level of evidence mandates its support with other emerging energy technologies. The evidence may even indicate that a crash program is the most rational policy.

Electrochemical models for the Fleischmann-Pons experiment 15th International Conference on Condensed Matter Nuclear Science The loading of Pd by hydrogen isotopes in the Fleischmann-Pons experiment does not seem to be well described by the hydrogen/deuterium evolution reaction model that is commonly used for hydrogen in metals. We consider modified versions of the model that may be more relevant to the loading of deuterium in Pd.
Arguments for dideuterium near monovacancies in PdD 15th International Conference on Condensed Matter Nuclear Science Molecular D2 does not form in bulk PdD because the electron density sufficiently high so that antibonding orbitals are occupied. The electron density can be lower in the vicinity of a vacancy. We examine the possibility that sigma-bonded dideuterium can occur at the lowered electron density near a monovacancy in PdD.

Coherent Energy Exchange in the Strong Coupling Limit of the Lossy Spin-Boson Model J. Condensed Matter Nucl. Sci. We focus on the lossy spin-boson model since it is capable of efficient energy exchange between two-level systems and an oscillator under conditions where the characteristic energy of the oscillator is small compared to the transition energy of the two-level systems. We are considering this model as the essential component for a theoretical understanding of the excess heat effect in the Fleischmann-Pons experiment. We introduce an iterative algorithm that allows the numerical calculation of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the coefficient eigenvalue equation that arises in the local approximation. From systematic calculations in the strong coupling limit we establish scaling laws for the self-energy and for the indirect coupling matrix element in the local approximation. These results are used to study the system dynamics for simple strong coupling models.

Maruhn-Greiner Maximum of Uranium Fission for Confirmation of Low Energy Nuclear Reactions LENR via a Compound Nucleus with Double Magic Numbers J. Fusion Energy One of the most convincing facts about LENR due to deuterons of very high concentration in host metals as palladium is the measurement of the large scale minimum of the reaction probability depending on the nucleon number A of generated elements at A = 153 where a local maximum was measured. This is similar to the fission of uranium at A = 119 where the local maximum follows from the Maruhn-Greiner theory if the splitting nuclei are excited to about MeV energy. The LENR generated elements can be documented any time after the reaction by SIMS or K-shell X-ray excitation to show the very unique distribution with the local maximum. An explanation is based on the strong Debye screening of the Maxwellian deuterons within the degenerate rigid electron background especially within the swimming electron layer at the metal surface or at interfaces. The deuterons behave like neutrals at distances of about 2 picometers. They may form clusters due to soft attraction in the range above thermal energy. Clusters of 10 pm diameter may react over long time probabilities (megaseconds) with Pd nuclei leading to a double magic number compound nucleus which splits like in fission to the A = 153 element distribution.
Radiochemical Observations for Comparison of Uranium Fission with Low Energy Nuclear Reactions LENR American Physical Society Meeting The discovery of nuclear fission by Hahn and Straßmann was based on a very rare microanalytical result what initially could not indicate the very complicated details of this most important process. A similarity is discussed for the low energy nuclear reactions (LENR) being proved from analogies of measurements of uranium fission. The distribution of the elements with uranium fission is similar to the element distribution with LENR. This was observed repeatedly and reproducibly with high density deuteron concentration in palladium. This discussion is specifically focussed to the Maruhn-Greiner local maximum of the distribution within the large-scale minimum if the fission nuclei are excited. The consequences of the complications in uranium fission are discussed in comparison with LENR with respect to the studies of a hypothetical fissioning compound nuclear reaction via a concluded element 306X126 with double magic numbers.

Bose–Einstein Condensation and Inverted Rydberg States in Ultra-high Density Deuterium Clusters Related to Low Energy Nuclear Reactions J. Condensed Matter Nucl. Sci. Results about low energy nuclear reactions (LENR) are related to very high density clusters of deuterons where properties of Bose-Einstein condensation and/or inverted Rydberg states are compared. A modification of Bohr’s atom model is used to overcome the problem that a quantum state with n = 1 does not emit radiation from an “orbiting” electron. This permits then the description of the inverted state of Rydberg matter in agreement with the recent measurements of Holmlid et al. for deuterium clusters with ultra-high deuteron densities in the range of 1029cm-3. A virtual oscillation model for laser excitation clusters explains the low intensity ionization threshold in clusters. MeV particle emission from LENR can then be compared with measurements from inverted Rydberg states.

Correlated Measurements of D2 Loading and 4He Production in Pd Lattice The Seventh International Conference on Cold Fusion Abstract A series of measurements have been performed on a thin sheet of Pd in D2  gas atmo­sphere with an electric field applied across its length. The results in terms of correlation between the average loading ratio near the cathode and in the middle of the sheet are reported: they indicate that under particular conditions the application of the electric field succeeds to shorten the loading time and to obtain local D/Pd ratios higher than the average value.

X-ray emission in the high-current glow discharge experiments  ABSTRACT X-ray emission with energy of 1.5 - 2 keV and intensity up to 100 R\sec was registered in the experiments with the high-current glow discharge in deuterium and hydrogen for cathodes made of Pd and other metals. The presence of two x-ray components: diffusion x-ray emission and x-ray emission in the form of laser beams were established by experiments. The laser x-ray emission was registered some msec later after turning off the current. The continuous mode of generating a laser x-ray beam with the diameter of 9mm and power of up to 10 W at the efficiency coefficient of electrical discharge power conversion into the x-ray laser emission up to 20% was obtained in some experiments.

Measurements of the D + D Reaction in Ti Metal with Incident Energies between 4.7 and 18 keV J. Phys. Soc. Japan 
 The Seventh International Conference on Cold Fusion Abstract Yields of protons emitted in the D + D reaction in Pd and PdO thick targets were measured for bombarding energies between 2.5 and 10 keV. The obtained yields were compared with those predicted by using the parameterization of cross sections at higher energies. It was found that both of the yields for Pd and PdO are surprisingly larger than the prediction. The bombarding energy dependence of the yields are well described with screening potential parameters; Ue = 250 eV for Pd and 600 eV for PdO. The significance of a simple extrapolation of the observed enhancement is discussed.

Theoretical criteria and experimental conditions for improving and optimizing D-D fusion rates in a gas/solid-state fusion device are described. It is shown that the surface fusion mechanism also provides a plausible explanation for the nonreproducibility of the results of electrolysis fusion experiments.

 The 12th International Conference on Condensed Matter Nuclear Science The most basic theoretical challenge for understanding low energy nuclear reaction (LENR) and transmutation reaction (LETR) in condensed matters is to find mechanisms by which the large Coulomb barrier between fusing nuclei can be overcome.  A unifying theory of LENR and LETR has been developed to provide possible mechanisms for the LENR and LETR processes in matters based on high-density nano-scale and micro-scale quantum plasmas.  It is shown that recently developed theoretical models based on Bose-Einstein Fusion (BEF) mechanism and Quantum Plasma Nuclear Fusion (QPNF) mechanism are applicable to the results of many different types of LENR and LETR experiments
Theory of Low-Energy Deuterium Fusion in Micro/Nano-Scale Metal Grains and Particles ICCF-14 International Conference on Condensed Matter Nuclear Science A consistent conventional theoretical description is presented for anomalous low-energy deuterium nuclear fusion in micro/nano-scale metal grains and particles. The theory is based on the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) state occupied by deuterons trapped in a micro/nano-scale metal grain or particle. The theory is capable of explaining most of the experimentally observed results and also provides theoretical predictions. Experimental tests of theoretical predictions are proposed. Scalabilities of the observed effects are discussed based on theoretical predictions.

Generalized Theory of Bose-Einstein Condensation Nuclear Fusion for Hydrogen-Metal System  
Nuclear Reactions in Micro/Nano-Scale Metal Particles  Low-energy nuclear reactions in micro/nano-scale metal particles are described based on the theory of Bose-Einstein condensation nuclear fusion (BECNF). The BECNF theory is based on a single basic assumption capable of explaining the observed LENR phenomena; deuterons in metals undergo Bose-Einstein condensation. The BECNF theory is also a quantitative predictive physical theory. Experimental tests of the basic assumption and theoretical predictions are proposed. Potential application to energy generation by ignition at low temperatures is described. Generalized theory of BECNF is used to carry out theoretical analyses of recently reported experimental results for hydrogen-nickel system.

Evidence for Production of Tritium via Cold Fusion Reactions in Deuterium Gas Loaded Palladium BARC Studies in Cold Fusion After the first announcement reporting the observation of cold fusion further evidence supporting the same has appeared in scientific literature although many other groups have failed to obtain positive results. Palladium and titanium loaded electrolytically and titanium loaded directly with deuterium gas have been reported to emit neutrons. Interestingly gas loading experiments involving Pd-D have not been reported so far. Such experiments were therefore conducted recently in our group. Tritium measurements in gas loaded Pd-D targets have been carried out. The present paper summarises the results obtained so far to ascertain whether cold fusion reactions occur in gas loaded Pd targets also.

The discussion of the quantum path of self could be bessered by a new model of quantum mechanical wave corpuscle.

The Change of Tritium Concentration during the Electrolysis of D2O in Various Electrolytic Cells  The U-type and bell jar type electrolytic cells were designed using pyrex glass and modified for recombination of gases with platinum catalysts. The electrolysis of LiOD/D2O in V-type cell yielded more final activities in Pt/Pd system than Pt/Pt system. Some electrolysis of LiOD/D2O in Pt/Pd showed the increase of 3T above 100%. The separation factor of D/T in electrolysis was not measured directly but assumed 2 ~ 3 from literature. The increase of 3T can not be explained with the isotope separation effect.
A Change of Tritium Content in D2O Solutions during Pd/D Co-deposition J. Condensed Matter Nucl. Sci. In this study electrochemical co-deposition of Pd/D on nickel electrodes was performed to determine whether a nuclear fusion reaction occurs in the palladium deposit. Co-deposition was performed with a palladium salt/D2O solution. The content of tritium in D2O solution was varied depending on the electrolysis procedure during co-deposition. A comparison between the co-deposition of Pd/D and the simple electrolysis of D2O was performed to investigate the change of tritium concentration in the D2O solution.

Tracks of Ball Lightning in Apparatus? J. Condensed Matter Nucl. Sci. Researchers of electrical discharge and electrolysis experiments have been finding microscopic markings that are unusual and anomalous. It is possible that these markings are made by microscopic objects that are in the size range of 400-0.1 Åm. These objects may be a type of microscopic ball lightning. They may share the anomalous characteristics of natural ball lightning. They are also finding highly anomalous material activity and emissions. Pictures of the markings and anomalous effects that were taken by six groups of researchers are shown and interpreted in this article.

Diamond-based Radiation Sensor for LENR Experiments. Part 1: Sensor Development and Characterization J. Condensed Matter Nucl. Sci. There have been many reports on charged particle and neutron production in LENR experiments but as of yet they have not been correlated in time with excess heat generation. Diamond sensors with palladium electrodes can be utilized to address this need. First results using a diamond sensor is presented.
Diamond-based Radiation Sensor for LENR Experiments. Part 2: Experimental Analysis of Deuterium-loaded Palladium J. Condensed Matter Nucl. Sci. The purpose of this paper is to report on the continued work on utilizing a palladium electrode on a diamond sensor in a pressurized hydrogen or deuterium environment to investigate the release of radiation during low energy nuclear reactions (LENR). In this investigation we conducted a long hydrogen exposure to see if palladium electrode delamination occurred due to chemical reactions and it was found that after seven days the electrode did not delaminate. A pressurized deuterium run was conducted immediately following the hydrogen exposure on the same sensor and some interesting count burst data was observed. Further analysis is required to determine what the observed effect could be  attributed to.
In-Situ Charactorization of Sputtered Pd Thin-Films Undergoing Electrolysis  In-situ measurements on the resistance and temperature variations of Pd thin films are carried out during electrolysis. The measurement is made possible by covering parts of the Pd films with a protective layer of thermal and electric insulators. Electrical contacts are made by using either silver epoxy or indium soldering. The resistance-loading curve deviates somewhat from the typical curve for a bulk Pd/H(D) system. The initial resistance increase shows a much faster hydrogen diffusion rate along the film axis than that observed in bulk systems. The characteristic resistance-loading curve is explained by the electronic band structures of Pd loaded with different H(D) fractions. An excess heat of 30% during the electrolysis process was detected using an open  calorimeter and a novel circuit switching methodology. The corresponding excess power density reaches 100 W/cm^3.

Anomalous heat Generation by surface oxidized Pd wires in a hydrogen atmosphere Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Anomalies in Hydrogen / Deuterium Loaded Metals Thin Pd wires (diameter 50 micrometers) surface oxidized through joule heating have been loaded in a hydrogen (H2) atmosphere at pressures in the range 1 - 10 bar. The atomic ratio H/Pd reached in the experimental conditions has been evaluated through its relationship with the electrical resistivity of hydrogen-loaded Pd. It was found that the loading rate of the surface oxidized Pd wires is exceptionally higher than with the untreated ones (full loading in a few minutes as compared with several hours). It was also observed that surface treated wires with H/Pd = 0.75 do not lose hydrogen even when joule heated at temperatures up to about 150°C in a Hydrogen atmosphere. When the wire temperature exceeds 150°C (applied power about 12.4 W) anomalous heat generation (about 3.5 W) was detected.

  A review is described for the Nattoh model that provides the framework of the mechanisms of cold fusion. The model classifies the reactions into two categories: fundamental and associated reactions. The former involves the “hydrogen-catalyzed” fusion reaction and the chain reactions of hydrogens. And extremely exciting physics are involved in the latter. Furthermore experimental findings are described.

Public Policy Planning for Broad Deployment of Cold Fusion for Energy Production in the U.S.: Technology Assessment of LENR Impacts  The introduction of technology can be viewed as throwing a rock into a body of water and the ripples which radiate outwards are the impacts to society with the strongest ripples being the structures of society which have a disturbance of the highest magnitude. Technology Assessment is one way that policymakers can predict where and how far those “ripples” will travel with the “splash” of a new technology.

An overview of excess heat production in deuterated palladium system IECEC Conference 
  The excess heat generated in electrochemical cells with palladium cathodes and heavy water electrolyte appears to be far too large to result from chemical or metallurgical transformation. The evidence implies that the heat source is a nuclear reaction of some as yet undetermined nature.

The Need for Triggering in Cold Fusion Reactions Tenth International Conference on Cold Fusion It has long been recognized that initiation of the cold fusion heat effect observed in heavy water electrolysis at palladium cathodes requires simultaneous attainment of three conditions: (i) high loading or chemical potential of D within the Pd lattice; (ii) an initiation time at least ten times larger than the D diffusion time constant: (iii) a minimum or threshold electrochemical surface current or current density that is not correlated to the bulk D loading. In 1995 a fourth condition was added with the recognition [5] that (iv) deuterium flux plays an important role in determining the excess heat power density.

 15th International Conference on Condensed Matter Nuclear Science With recent publicity outside the GRINS field it has become increasingly important to clarify in non-specialist terms what is known and what is understood in the general field of so called Low Energy or lattice Enhanced Nuclear Reactions (LENR). It is also crucial and timely to expose and elaborate what objections or reservations exist with regard to these new understandings. In essence we are concerned with the answers to the following three questions: What do we think we know? Why do we think we know it? Why do doubts still exist in the broader scientific community?

Electrochemical insertion of hydrogen into metals and alloys Infinite Energy 
Electrochemical loading of hydrogen and deuterium into palladium and palladium-boron alloys  Excess power production and other anomalous effects have been observed during the electrolysis of heavy water using palladium and palladium-boron alloys as the cathode materials. This study focused on hydrogen and deuterium loading into palladium and palladium-boron alloys. Improved calorimetry provided for the detection of the exothermic heat of absorption of deuterium into palladium and palladium-alloy cathodes. The addition of boron to palladium does not significantly affect the initial loading rate but slows further loading to higher levels. The presence of boron in the palladium significantly slows the rate of the deloading process. Cracks or other surface defects prevent high loading levels of hydrogen or deuterium into palladium or palladium-boron alloys.

The Eyring Rate Theory Applied to Cold Fusion J. Condensed Matter Nucl. Sci. The Eyring Absolute Rate Theory is generally applied to chemical reactions where bonds between atoms are broken and new bonds formed to give a transition state or activated complex. This theory has also been applied to physical rate processes such as diffusion and the viscosity of liquids. The activation parameters obtained from the Eyring theory when applied to cold fusion are all suggestive of a deuterium fusion rate controlled by the diffusion of deuterons within the palladium lattice. The D+D fusion process in the Pd/D system is apparently a zero-ordered reaction where only a small fraction of the reactants are in a location in which they are able to react.

Clusters with Picometer Distance of Deuterons and LENR (PowerPoint slides) 15th International Conference on Condensed Matter Nuclear Science The probability of pm-Ms reactions for low energy nuclear reactions LENR and the semiempirical derivation of 2 pm deuteron screening on palladium with a reduction factor 14 in Coulomb repulsion compared with a usual plasma factor 5 was confirmed later by direct experiments. Generation of 2pm distance clusters of about 150 deuterons based on this screening and possibly by a Casimir force permitted understanding of compound reactions as measured with the 155 nucleon minimum measured at LENR. These kinds of deuteron clusters were directly measured by SQUID. Based on screening and comparable values of a Wigner-Seitz radius for very dense deuteron clusters of stable Rydberg matter in defects of iron oxide with measured 2.3 pm nuclear distance is another access which may lead to an understanding of the LENR processes.

The excess heat was observed when a Pd sample was filled with deuterium in D/Pd ~0.90 by cathodic charging. The excess heat increased with D/Pd in an exponential manner: the heat was of the order of magnitude of 0.1 Watt/cm^2 at D/PD ~1.0.

Neutron Emission and Surface Observation During a Long-Term Evolution of Deuterium on Pd in 0.1 M LiOD  Long-term electrolysis for well annealed thick Pd rods (9.0 and 21.2 mm diameter) in 0.1 M LiOD have been performed to examine anomalous phenomena; neutron emission and heat bursts. The count rate of neutron (CRN) bunched for 3 h showed no significant increase at low current densities. High CRN appeared a few days later after the current increased to 102.4 mA/cm2 and the temperature was raised to 50°C. In two experiments CRN and neutron energy spectrum of 2.45 MeV was reproduced.

Trace Elements Added to Palladium by Exposure to Gaseous Deuterium 8th International Conference on Cold Fusion This is an experimental program to investigate possible trace element changes brought about in palladium (Pd) after extensive electrolysis in heavy water electrolytes as well as long time contact of particulate Pd with gaseous deuterium. Of particular interest are cathodes and particulate Pd which had experienced episodes of excess heat production beyond all electrical and other inputs. This paper details the careful analysis by neutron activation analysis (NAA) of a set of three samples of finely powdered Pd exposed to high deuterium pressures (hundreds of atmospheres) near room temperature at the core of hollow cylindrical Pd cathodes. A fourth sample of unused Pd powder from the same batch used in the cathodes was analyzed as a control. The most prominent change observed in the three active samples versus the virgin Pd was the Zn-64 content. The active samples showed an increase in the Zn-64 isotope of 6 to 14 times that in the virgin Pd. Speculation regarding the source of this increased zinc varies from contamination during electron beam welding (used to seal off the hollow core) to nuclear reactions generated by high pressure deuterium gas on the large surface area Pd particles in the core.

Reduced radioactivity of tritium in small titanium particles Phys. Lett. A By heating a TiT0.0035 preparation consisting of extremely small monocrystalline particles (diameter &#8776; 15 nm) a decrease of the radioactivity by 40% was observed. In further experiments the concentration of tritium in such preparations was varied (TiTx experiments) showing that the radioactivity of the tritium increased less than proportionally to its concentration. Careful analysis of the experiments seems to rule out the possibility of trivial errors. A provisional hypothetical explanation is formulated. Our experiments may point to a connection with cold DD-fusion.

Investigation of Nuclear Emissions in the Process of D(H) Escaping from Deuterized (Hydrogenized) PdO-Pd-PdO and PdO-Ag Samples  Emission of proton-like and neutron-like events was observed in the process of escaping deuterium from deuterized PdO-Pd-Ag and PdO-Pd-PdO samples. The ratio of the proton-like and neutron-like event fluxes was estimated as Np/Nn ~ 1.The charged particle emission was also observed in the process of escaping hydrogen from hydrogenized PdO-Pd-Ag and PdO-Pd-PdO samples. The emitted charged particles may be identified asprotons and a-particles. Investigation of charged-particle emission was carried out by 3 methods: (1) plastic scintillation counter; (2) Si-SSD; (3) CR-39 plastic track detector. The results obtained by these independent methods are in good agreement with each other.An effect of the weak thermal neutron flux on the processesof cold fusion in the samples loaded with D(H) was also investigated. It was observed that the flux of neutrons emitted from deuterized PdO-Pd-Ag samples exposed by thermal neutrons was approximately 300 times as large as in the case of unexposed samples.

Statistical Analysis of Neutron Emission in Cold Fusion Experiments The First Annual Conference on Cold Fusion The paper discusses two techniques for studying the multiplicity spectrum of neutron emission in cold fusion experiments. In the first method the multiplicity distribution of counts in 20 ms time intervals is analysed to give information about the statistics of neutron emission in cold fusion. The results of six such experiments indicate that about 10 to 25% of the neutrons produced in cold fusion are emitted in the form of bunches 400 to 600 neutrons each. The other method discussed is an adaptation of the Artificial Dead Time method developed originally for reactor noise analysis as well as for the passive neutron assay of plutonium. An expression for the fractional loss of counts in the presence of dead time is derived. It is shown that a neutron detection efficiency of ~ 1% is adequate to estimate the average multiplicity as well as the fraction of bunched neutron emission in the presence of a Poisson background.

My life with cold fusion as a reluctant mistress Infinite Energy Over 9 years have passed since many of us were lured into believing that the Pons-Fleischmann effect would solve the world’s energy problems and make us all rich. Things have not yet worked out as we had hoped. Each of us have followed a different path through the labyrinth of this expectation. I would like to share with you my particular path and show you how I came to believe that problems of reproducibility are caused solely by the properties of the materials in which the nuclear reactions are proposed to occur.

The Present Status of Cold Fusion and its Expected Influence on Science and Technology Innovative Energy Policies 
Explaining Cold Fusion J. Condensed Matter Nucl. Sci. Five assumptions are used to create a new explanation of low energy nuclear reactions (cold fusion) based on formation of a novel active environment within a variety of materials. The method to form this environment and the nuclear consequences are described. The fusion process is proposed to occur when a form of metallic hydrogen is created in nano-cracks. Methods to test the model are provided. Engineering variables are identified and used to show how the process can be controlled and amplified. These assumptions can also be used to evaluate other proposed explanations.
In the Spirit of John Bockris J. Condensed Matter Nucl. Sci. The life of Prof. John Bockris provides a reminder of how good science should be undertaken and the harm a scientist and all of science suffer when these expectations are ignored.

The enthalpy of formation of PdH as a function of H/Pd atom ratio and treatment (PowerPoint slides) The 21st International Conference for Condensed Matter Nuclear Science ICCF-21 Production of the LENR effect involves achieving a large concentration of D in the PdD lattice structure. A great deal of effort has been applied to understanding how this can be accomplished and the nature of the resulting structure. The bulk properties play a role in this process but are sensitive to the impurity content and treatment. The influence of the bulk properties on this process has not been fully explored.
  
Relationship between the burnishing process used by Mizuno and the Storms theory of NAE formation  Mizuno [1] has applied Pd to Ni mesh by burnishing and claimed to make excess energy by heating the material in D2 gas. This method is expected to produce the conditions predicted by Storms to cause LENR. The relationship between the burnishing method and the Storms theory of LENR is described as well as several testable predictions.

Calorimetry Of Pulse Electro-Melting of PdDx Wires 15th International Conference on Condensed Matter Nuclear Science Several groups have reported anomalous effects (heat and nuclear products) in thin PdDx materials stimulated by different forms of electro-diffusion. We have designed and tested a calorimeter utilizes an “exploding wire” technique to examine the effect of a destructive electrodiffusion on a highly loaded PdDx wire. We have shown that highly loaded PdDx wires can be formed using high voltage electrolysis of very high purity D2O with a very thin Pd wire cathode and a thin Pt wire anode. The addition a partial monolayer of a recombination poison yields a highly loaded PdDx cathode. Following that step with the addition of a larger amount of that same poison seals the loaded wire and allows transfer to a cryogenic calorimeter. Our liquid nitrogen boil-off cryogenic calorimeter has been shown to have an accuracy of less than 0.4 J.

Experimental discovery and investigation of the phenomenon of nuclear transmutation of isotopes in growing biological cultures Infinite Energy 
Experimental discovery of phenomenon of low-energy nuclear transformation of isotopes (Mn55=Fe57) in growing biological cultures  For the first time the experimental study of cold nuclear transmutation of isotopes was carried out in growing microbiological culture with controlled conditions of growth. With the help of Mossbauer effect the formation of Fe5? isotope from Mn55 in nutrient medium based on heavy water was observed. The possible mechanism of low-temperature nuclear transmutation is discussed.
The Experimental Discovery of the Phenomenon of Controlling and Changing Probability and Time of Spontaneous Decay and Gamma-Transmutation of Excited Nuclei Statuses  The paper discusses the process of controlling the probability of spontaneous decay of radioactive and excited Mossbauer nuclei. For the first time two experiments have proved the possibility of changing the life time of radioactive nuclei by surrounding them with screens having resonant absorption frequency equal to the nuclear transition frequency. For the first time in the experiments with gamma sources C057(Fe57*) and Sn119m and with gamma absorbers Fe57 and Sn119 we have discovered the change of Mossbauer transition life-time by 20-100% and total life-time (including non- Mossbauer radiation and electron conversion) by 0.6-2%.

The Theory And Experimental Investigation Of Controlled Spontaneous Conversion Nuclear Decay Of Radioactive Isotopes Tenth International Conference on Cold Fusion This paper paper discusses the theory and results of a direct experimental investigation into the control of internal electron conversion channels of radioactive isotopes' spontaneous decay. This occurs by controlling the action of an oriented crystal matrix on the motion of conversion electrons. The same effect takes place at any beta-processes (including at decay of a neutron with an emission of electrons and neutrino). It was shown that parameters of internal electron conversion decay greatly depended on the structure of the crystal matrix and on the distance between the excited nucleus and the crystal matrix.
Successful Experiments On Utilization Of High-Activity Waste In The Process Of Transmutation In Growing Associations Of Microbiological Cultures Tenth International Conference on Cold Fusion The problem of utilization of high-activity waste by effect of nuclear transmutation in growing associations of microbiological cultures was study.

Application of Correlated States of Interacting Particles in Nonstationary and Periodical Modulated LENR Systems J. Condensed Matter Nucl. Sci. In the report the universal mechanism of optimization of low energy nuclear reactions on the basis of coherent correlated states of interacting particles at different kinds of nonstationary periodical action to the system is considered. We have considered the peculiarities and investigated the efficiency of the creation of a correlated state under a periodic action on a harmonic oscillator. This method is shown to lead to rapid formation of a strongly correlated particle state that provides an almost complete clearing of the potential barrier even for a narrow range of oscillator frequency variations. Several successful low energy fusion experiments based on usage of correlated states of interacting particles are discussed.

Tritium Production in Palladium Deuteride/Hydride in Evacuated Chamber 8th International Conference on Cold Fusion The controlled out-diffusion method was employed to induce a nuclear reaction in a palladium (Pd) plate with a MnOx film. The time-resolved mass spectra for Pd deuteride revealed tritium (T) production during the out-diffusion experiment. Similar time behaviors of mass number 1-4 and 6 in the spectra was also observed for Pd hydride. Film blackening was observed for most Pd deuteride as well as Pd hydrides using a normal monochromatic negative photographic film. The radiation from the Pd plate consists of two kinds of components for a Pd hydride. Secondary ion mass spectroscopy has shown considerable increase in counts of Li for Pd hydride after the out-diffusion experiment.

Voltammograms of thin layer Pd/H(D) electrodes in the coexistence of a and ÃƒÅ¸ phases J. Electroanal. Chem. The kinetics of a thin layer Pd H(D) electrode at the coexistence of &#945; and &#946; phases in cyclic voltammetry are studied and the effects of various parameters are discussed. It is found that the voltammogram of the &#945; &#8596; &#946; phase transition is trigonal in shape which differs significantly from those for diffusion and adsorption. The kinetic characteristics of the &#945; + &#946; mixed region are controlled by the deviation of parameters from the thermodynamic values. These results indicate that cyclic voltammetry can be used for studying the kinetics of phase transition occurring in a layer electrode. The present treatment is verified by comparison with the previous experimental results.

Characteristics of Excess Heat in Pd|D2O+D2SO4 Electrolytic Cells Measured by Seebeck Envelope Calorimetry 15th International Conference on Condensed Matter Nuclear Science 
 Thermochim. Acta A Seebeck Envelope Calorimeter (SEC) was designed and built. The inner volume is 17.6 L. Its outer wall temperature was controlled within 0.01°C. The device constant was 6 W/V and its time constant was 5 minutes. Dash-type cells were tested. Both an isoperibolic calorimeter and the SEC measured excess heat with the same Pd cathode of 25 × 25 × 0.3 mm3. The SEC showed excess heat ranging from 0.15 ± 0.02 to 0.41 ± 0.03 W (average value 0.22 W) at applied current of 3 to 3.5 A (0.24 to 0.28 A cm^-2).
