"March 15, 2013. Abstract: This paper reviews the author’s recent works on the basic physics of cold fusion by the TSC (tetrahedral symmetric condensate) theory. Models of TSC formation conditions in condensed matter are first proposed. Secondly formulas for cold fusion rates per D(H)-cluster are explained with typical quantitative results. The 4D/TSC fusion and the 4H/TSC WS fusion are underlying mechanisms, respectively for the D (deuterium)-system and the H (protium)-system. Key words: Cold fusion,"
"condensed matter, TSC theory, D(H)-cluster, 4D fusion, 4H WS fusion.   Introduction The multi-body fusion and TSC (tetrahedral symmetric condensate) theory has been elaborated for 23 years since April 1989 [1]. The basic concept is that the ordering/constraint conditions of particles (namely deuterons, protons and electrons) in condensed matter containing deuterium (D) and/or protium (H) should make unique “hither-to-unknown” multi-body D(H)-cluster fusion reactions measurable under the dynamic constraint"

Here, D(H)-cluster includes two deuterons (or protons) systems as d-e-d (p-e-p) and d-e-e-d (p-e-e-p), as well as 3D(H), 4D(H), 6D(H) and so forth. And e denotes electron.

The condensation time for 4D/TSC is so short as 1.4 fs and the yield of 4D/TSC fusion per TSC is 1.0 (100%) [3]. The macroscopic fusion rate by the TSC theory is given by the product of two rates as, ^Macroscopic Fusion Rate^ ^ Cluster Formation Rate^ ^ ^Microscopic Fusion Yield per TSC^ (1) And the microscopic fusion rate is defined by the time-dependent cluster condensation motion (inter-"

The D(H)-cluster formation rate should be defined to reflect in dynamic conditions of near-surface-physics/chemistry and finite lattice (as in nano-metal particle) of solid state physics/chemistry of condensed matter as D(H)-loaded metal electrodes, D(H)-loaded nano-metal-powder composites or some other materials used for cold fusion studies.

A typical design of nano-composite metal powder being used currently in D(H)-gas loading experiments is shown in Fig. 1.

In the thermo dynamics view, system energy is transferred via the phonon energy exchange between trapped D(H)s in QM oscillation and the outside phonons of substrate (ceramics supporter) as shown in Fig. 5 for imagination.

Quantitative QM calculations for these TSC formation process are very complex due to so many-body time-dependent problems under the ordering/constraint conditions of condensed matter, to study further.

During the continuous condensation motion, we can employ an ‘adiabatic’ state (for digitizing very small time-steps) of ‘quasi-molecule’ confining potential and 4D (or d-d pair) wave function, as illustrated in Fig. 7. In the QM-Langevin calculation, Gaussian-type d-d pair wave-functions in a 4D/TSC were employed [2, 3] to implement the ‘quasi-eigen-values’ search for the adiabatic state, by using the variational method [3].

In other approximate treatment, the second term is calculated by using the WKB approximation with Gamow integral, as called as the barrier penetration probability. The approximate"

The “adiabatic” size of 4D/TSC reaches at a few tens fm size in 1.4 fs, so fast. With adiabatic 4D/TSC size around 20 fm, 4D-fusion takes place by 100% yield [2, 3] in 2 × 10-20 s, namely, D + D + D + D → 8Be*(Ex= 47.6 MeV: Jπ) (4) The break up channels of 8Be* are very complex, according to the very deformed nucleon (n or p) halo admixture"

The reason is that the confined d-d pair in “deep” electro-magnetic (or Coulombic) trapping potential should decrease its de Broglie wave length to be constrained by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP).

However, there is no strong-fusion interaction (PEF = 0) between 4 protons of TSC to finally destroy the TSC state. We conceive that 4H/TSC can condense further to be as ultimately small 4H/TSC-minimum state as a few fm size (2.4 fm p-p distance is the limit, due to hard core of proton with 1.2 fm radius). The problem there is how long the 4H/TSC-minimum state can survive. We need a study by using a relativistic"

The converted figure of condensation motion for 4H/TSC is shown in Fig. 12.

As the pion range 1.4 fm is the Heisenberg Uncertainty in distance, the n + 3p reaction takes place by 100 % with <W> value of PEF = 3 (comparable to d-t fusion and very strong fusion sticking force) [9]. 3p + n → 4Li*(Ex = 4.62 MeV) (6) The intermediate compound 4Li* has two break-up channels. 4Li*(Ex = 4.62 MeV) → 3He + p + 7.72 MeV    (7) 4Li*(Ex = 4.62 MeV) → 2p + d + 2.22 MeV     (8) The branch (7) is thought to be a major out-going channel and we will expect 3He as main nuclear"

However, we do not know the branching ratio to the branch (8) which will not produce secondary neutrons and gamma-rays at all. We need further study for it. So the"
"key problem is how much weak interaction rate to generate neutron-nucleon (not free neutron) is probable in the duration of 4H/TSC-minimum state. The weak interaction rate is given by <WIrate >= (4π /h)<W >wΨe(rw)> 2     (9) The detail of weak interaction rate calculation is given in Ref. [9]. As the Compton wave length of weak bosons (W+, W-) is extremely short as 2.5 × 10-18 m (2.5 am), the second term of Eq. (9), the weight of electron wave function from outer EM field, is so small as 5.9 × 10-5, and <W>"

If we assume the life time of 4H/TSC minimum to be as same as the 4D/TSC-minimum, namely ca. 2 × 10-20 s, the weak interaction yield is very small as 3 × 4H/TSC-minimum state is estimated to be 10-38 f/s, by using the S value 3.4 × 10-22 keVb and the relative p-p kinetic energy 100 keV for the two-body reaction rate formula (Fermi’s second golden rule [4]). Assuming that the lifetime is 1 fs of 4H/TSC-minimum, the p-p weak-fusion yield is 10-53 f/TSC that is negligibly"

Possibility of 4H/TSC + Ni Fission As the inner-most (K) electron shell of Ni atom has ca. 1 pm radius of 1S orbit and additional shell electrons “protect” Ni nucleus from in-coming proton to make Ni + p nuclear reaction, two-body strong interaction between metal nucleus and proton (or deuteron) is impossibly difficult.

As the nature of condensed matter is the ordering/constraint dynamic conditions on confining particles of deuterons, protons and electrons in electro-magnetically induced dynamic trapping potentials, D(H)-cluster formation and its transient motion has been thought as a clue to solve the puzzle of cold fusion.
