# UMLENR - Utilizing Machine Learning for LENR/LANR

**Repository**: [UMLENR GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ConsciousEnergy/UMLENR)

## Overview

This repository explores the application of machine learning algorithms to better understand and optimize Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR) and Lattice-Assisted Nuclear Reactions (LANR). By leveraging data analytics and machine learning, we aim to shed light on the complex mechanisms behind LENR, accelerating its development as a clean and abundant energy source.

## Introduction

LENR has long been a subject of scientific curiosity and debate. Despite its promise for clean and abundant energy, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This project aims to use machine learning to analyze existing LENR data and predict outcomes of various experimental setups.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Scripts for preprocessing LENR datasets.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Predict LENR outcomes using regression, classification, and clustering techniques.
- **Simulation Framework**: Tools and algorithms to simulate LENR events, including fusion cross-sections, reaction rates, and excess heat generation.
- **Photo-Electric Effects Simulation**: Models electron densities and momentum in the photoelectric effect from the Planck scale up to the molecular scale.
- **Electron Interaction Simulation**: Generates a cubic array of electrons and calculates the Coulomb interaction energy between them.
- **Decay Process Simulation**: Models the decay processes of various isotopes, including tritium and short-lived hydrogen isotopes.
- **Visualization**: Interactive visualization tools for data analysis and simulation results.
