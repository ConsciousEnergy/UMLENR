## UMLENR
Utilizing Machines for Low Energy Nuclear Reactions. 
*Work in Progress*
##Overview

This repository aims to explore the application of machine learning algorithms to better understand and optimize Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR). By leveraging data analytics and machine learning, we hope to shed light on the complex mechanisms behind LENR, thereby accelerating its development as a clean and abundant energy source.

## Introduction

LENR has long been a subject of scientific curiosity and debate. Despite its promise for clean and abundant energy, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This project aims to use machine learning to analyze existing LENR data and predict outcomes of various experimental setups.

## Features

- Data preprocessing scripts for LENR datasets [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/ConsciousEnergies)
- Machine learning models for predicting LENR outcomes
- Visualization tools for data analysis
- A comprehensive guide for creating a working LENR reactor design

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ConsciousEnergies/UMLENR.git
cd ML_for_LENR
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
